THE COMBINED USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND COCITATION FOR DOCUMENT
RETRIEVAL.
     
A LINKAGE SIMILARITY MEASURE WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
COUPLING OF DOCUMENTS AND THEIR COCITATIONS (BOTH CITED AND CITING PAPERS)
PRODUCED IMPROVED DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL OVER A MEASURE BASED ONLY ON
BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING. THE TEST COLLECTION CONSISTED OF 1,712 PAPERS WHOSE
RELEVANCE TO SPECIFIC QUERIES HAD BEEN JUDGED BY USERS. OVERALL, THE CHANGE
FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING MEASURE TO THE LINKAGE SIMILARITY MEASURE,
REPRESENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF COCITATION DATA, RESULTED IN BETTER RETRIEVAL
PERFORMANCE.
