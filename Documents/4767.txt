IMPROVING NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS THROUGH INCREASING SCREENING AND
EVALUATION IN THE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAM.
     
THE CURRENT STATUS OF NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED IF THE
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THIS UNDERSTANDING WILL ONLY
BE GAINED IF A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FACTORS GENERALLY INFLUENCING
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IS DEVELOPED, AND PARTICULARLY THOSE FACTORS AFFECTING
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM GOVERNMENT R AND D AGENCIES TO INDUSTRY. SECONDARY
UTILISATION OF AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS
ON A TRANSFER PROCESS WHICH CROSSES ESTABLISHED ORGANISATIONAL LINES OF
AUTHORITY AND WHICH IS OUTSIDE WELL UNDERSTOOD PATTERNS OF TECHNICAL
APPLICATIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
