A COMPARISON BETWEEN MOBILE AND STATIONARY LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS WITH
REFERENCE TO COSTS AND PERFORMANCE.
     
THERE IS STILL DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER MOBILE OR STATIONARY LIBRARIES
PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE FOR RURAL AREAS WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 5,000. MOBILE
LIBRARIES PERMIT FLEXIBLE ORGANISATION AND CAN COME CLOSE TO USERS' HOMES;
THEY ARE OPERATED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO BRING A LARGE AND VARIED BOOK
STOCK SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL RESERVES. SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN 1 PLACE FOR A
SHORT TIME, HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT EASILY BECOME CULTURAL CENTRES. SMALL
STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS HAVE SMALL, RESTRICTED STOCKS AND
ARE RARELY SERVED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. A COMPARISON OF INITIAL AND RUNNING
COSTS FOR MOBILE AND SMALL STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN MIDDLE FRANCONIA
REVEALS THAT MOBILE LIBRARY PROVISION IS THE CHEAPER METHOD AND A COMPARISON
OF PERFORMANCES, THAT IT IS THE MORE EFFICIENT.
