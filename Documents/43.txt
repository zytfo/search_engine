THE FUTURE OF THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION IN QUEBEC: TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
RESEARCH.

THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION IN QUEBEC CURRENTLY FACES A STATE OF CRISIS BECAUSE OF
LACK OF FINANCE, PERSONNEL, AND PROVISION FOR TRAINING. TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH
THE NECESSITY FOR AND THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COURSE IN ARCHIVE
STUDIES, PARALLELS ARE DRAWN WITH DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL, SHOWING THE
SIMILARITIES OF THE TASKS INVOLVED AND THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE 2 FIELDS OF
OPERATION. A PROGRAMME OF STUDIES WHICH WOULD SERVE FOR BOTH IS OUTLINED. THE
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE URGED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ARCHIVE TRAINING,
AND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE A SECURE FUTURE FOR PRIVATE
AND PUBLIC ARCHIVES IN THE PROVINCE.
