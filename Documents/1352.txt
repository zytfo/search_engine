ON THE STABILITY OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BY TRUESWELL.

APPLICATION OF RULES FOR WEEDING THAT ARE BASED UPON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION
OF DEMAND OVER THE COLLECTION REQUIRE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION REMAIN STABLE OVER
TIME. A MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION IS DERIVED THAT TESTS THAT STABILITY.
VERIFICATION OF THE EXPRESSION IS NOT INORDINATELY TIME CONSUMING AND IS VERY
EASY IN THE CASE OF AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS. THE TECHNIQUE WAS FIRST
INTRODUCED BY RICHARD W. TRUESWELL UN 2AMERICAN DOCUMENTATION1 (16) 1965,
