BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENT SECRETS.

US GOVERNMENT LIBRARIANS USE A VARIETY OF SOURCES BEYOND THE USUAL WHO'S WHOS
TO LOCATE BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON US AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, INTERNATIONAL
FIGURES, AND US GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THESE SOURCES INCLUDE ON-LINE SERVICES,
BOOKS AND BACK FILES, THE CARD CATALOGUE, STATE DEPARTMENT AND CIA
PUBLICATIONS, OTHER GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND TRADE PUBLICATIONS. IN ADDITION,
TELEPHONE CONTACTS ARE OFTEN USEFUL. LISTS OF CIA BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORIES AND
US GOVERNMENT AGENCY PRESS OFFICES ARE APPENDED.
