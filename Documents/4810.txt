THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND ON THE PART OF HIGH-SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,
AS WELL AS THE GENERAL READING PUBLIC, FOR INFORMATION INCLUDED IN HEBREW
PERIODICALS. IT IS SURPRISING, THEREFORE, HOW FEW EDITORS HAVE SUPPLIED THEIR
READERS WITH CUMULATIVE INDEXES. NOTES 8 ITEMS-CURRENT AND RETROSPECTIVE-WHICH
INDEX MORE THAN 1 HEBREW PERIODICAL. IN THE 2ND SECTION, LISTS 115 PUBLISHED
CUMULATIVE INDEXES TO HEBREW PERIODICALS AND 6 MORE WHICH EXIST ONLY AS CARD
FILES IN THE JUDAICA READING ROOM OF THE JEWISH NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, JERUSALEM.
