THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE-WHAT DO THEY REALLY DO?.

THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE LIBRARY SERVICE AND
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE TO ADVISE ON DEWEY CLASSIFICATION IN NORWAY. ITS
NEW GEOGRAPHICAL TABLES (SUGGESTIONS, NOT INSTRUCTIONS), AIM TO HELP, FOR
INSTANCE, LIBRARIES WITH LARGE LOCAL COLLECTIONS. BASICALLY THEY FOLLOW DDC
19, DIVIDING NORWAY INTO 4 MAIN SECTIONS (AS AGAINST THE EARLIER ARNESEN
DIVISION INTO 3) WITH FURTHER DIVISIONS BY COUNTY, DISTRICT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITY. COMMENTS FROM LIBRARIES WERE INVITED: 1 SUGGESTION THAT ARNESEN
NOTATION SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR NORTH NORWAY HAS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR FUTURE US
EDITIONS. A NEW EDITION OF ARNESEN (THE CURRENT NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY,
BASED ON DDC 17) IS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
THERE WILL BE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE 300 CLASSES, CORRESPONDING TO DDC 19.
SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES, NOTES AND INDEXES WILL BE IMPROVED, AND LIBRARIES WILL
BE ABLE TO CLASSIFY BROADLY OR MORE PRECISELY AS REQUIRED.
