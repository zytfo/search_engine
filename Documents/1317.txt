MANAGERIAL RATING' A LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MODEL.

IN NOV 71, AN AD-HOC COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
WAS ASKED TO DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES COULD BE APPLIED TO REFERENCE
ACTIVITIES AND, IF SO, TO PROPOSE SOME METHOD FOR COLLECTING THE NECESSARY
DATA. SEVERAL EFFECTIVENESS MODELS WERE STUDIED AND DISCARDED. THE COMMITTEE
THEN TRIED THE MANAGERIAL RATING MODEL, WHEREBY MANAGERS MEET TO IDENTIFY
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THEN RECONVENE AFTER A GIVEN TIME TO RATE THEIR LEVELS
OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. A TRIAL INDICATED THAT THIS MODEL WAS SUITABLE AND THE
COMMITTEE REPORTED ACCORDINGLY, BUT NO FULL TRIAL EVER TOOK PLACE AND THE
COMMITTEE WAS DISBANDED. SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE METHOD'S POSSIBLE
DISADVANTAGES AND A LACK OF INTEREST.
