SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL SITUATION OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

A POSTGRADUATE PAPER PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL, BRAZIL, EXAMINING THE
VALIDITY OF THE SCIENTIFIC STATUS CLAIMED FOR LIBRARIANSHIP. THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS CLARIFIED, AND RECENT THEORETICAL STUDIES ON
LIBRARY SCIENCE ADDUCED AS EVIDENCE THAT ALTHOUGH IN THEORY LIBRARIANSHIP IS
SCIENTIFIC IN CHARACTER, IN PRACTICE IT IS RATHER A TECHNOLOGY. IN CONCLUSION
THE NON-SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF LIBRARIANSHIP ARE ANALYSED AND A
PROGRAMME PRESENTED FOR ACHIEVING A PROPER SCIENTIFIC BASIS.
