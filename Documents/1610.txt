VIDEO FEVER.
     
LIBRARIES' FASCINATION WITH VIDEO IS RESULTING IN SOME ALARMING TRENDS. MEDIA
COLLECTIONS ARE BEING UNDULY INFLUENCED IN FAVOUR OF PUBLIC FILMS-ON-VIDEO,
JEOPARDISING THE CONCEPT OF COLLECTION-BUILDING FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION;
MEDIA FORMATS ARE BEING CONFUSED-BECAUSE FEATURE FILMS ARE THE MAIN CONTENT OF
HOME VIDEO, MANY THINK THAT THE TERMS FILM, VIDEOTAPE, AND VIDEODISC ARE
INTERCHANGEABLE; AND THERE IS THE MANIPULATION OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION BY
THE VIDEO ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS IN THE NEW FORMAT AND
NOTHING IN THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION. THE NEW VIDEO
TECHNOLOGIES DO HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL, BUT IT IS NOT FINANCIALLY REALISABLE OR
PRACTICABLE FOR LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES MUST MAINTAIN THEIR HIGH STANDARDS AND
CONTINUE TO COLLECT ALL MEDIA.
