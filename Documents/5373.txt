CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION' HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN
DEBATE, 1850-1950.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF UK AND US IDEAS ON SUBJECT HEADINGS AND
CLASSIFICATION FROM THE TIME OF PANIZZI'S CHALLENGE TO CLASSIFIED CATALOGUING
THROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF CUTTER AND HULME TO THE WORK OF BLISS.
CUTTER AND HULME NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PRACTICAL APPROACH, LEAVING THE
WAY CLEAR FOR THE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATIONISTS SUCH AS OTLET AND RICHARDSON.
UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES AND
ALSO THE BEGINNING OF A DECISIVE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT CULMINATES IN THE
WORK OF BLISS. HIS GREAT VALUE IS THAT HE OFFERS AN INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE ON
THE HISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION AND IS REASONABLY
ENCOURAGING ABOUT COLON CLASSIFICATION, THE SYSTEM THAT ENDED THE FORMATIVE
CLASSIFICATIONIST PERIOD IN ANGLO-AMERICAN THOUGHT.
