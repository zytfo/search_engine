ANOTHER LOOK AT OCLC'S POTENTIAL FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES.
     
THE ISSUE OF OCLC BENEFITS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF
'FIND RATES'. A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE REVEALED THAT 21% OF A SPECIAL
COLLECTION'S HOLDINGS WERE IN THE OCLC DATA BASE AND WERE SCATTERED AMONG 95
LIBRARIES. THIS LOW FIND RATE IS USEFUL FOR DOCUMENTING THE UNIQUENESS OF THE
SPECIAL COLLECTION AND THE LACK OF EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL FOR SUCH
MATERIAL. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SPECIAL LIBRARIES CONSIDER OCLC
PARTICIPATION WHEN FIND RATES ARE LOW BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS OTHER THAN COST
SAVINGS FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES.
