THE CEC PLANS FOR ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY.
     
OUTLINES A PROPOSED COMMUNITY PLAN FOR ACTION IN THE FIELD OF ELECTRONIC
PUBLISHING AND DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS. THE PLAN WAS PREPARED TOGETHER WITH THE
DOCUMENT DELIVERY TASK FORCE OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CIDST) WHICH ADVISES THE COMMISSION
ON IDST MATTERS. THE ACTION PROGRAMME CONCENTRATES ON A NUMBER OF PILOT
EXPERIMENTS COVERING THE WHOLE CHAIN OF FUNCTIONS FROM DOCUMENT ORDERING TO
THE DELIVERY ON THE USER'S DESK. EXPERIMENTS WILL ALSO INCLUDE SATELLITE
COMMUNICATION TESTS, AND THEY WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY A NUMBER OF STUDIES,
SOME OF THEM DEALING WITH NON-TECHNICAL ISSUES SUCH AS COPYRIGHT.
