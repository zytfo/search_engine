MODEL POLICY CONCERNING COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PHOTOCOPYING FOR CLASSROOM,
RESEARCH AND LIBRARY RESERVE USE.
     
PRESENTS A MODEL POLICY FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PHOTOCOPYING,
PREPARED BY THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WITH ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE FROM
COPYRIGHT LAWYERS AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. OUTLINES FAIR USE RIGHTS IN THE
ACADEMIC CONTEXT (E.G. FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LIBRARY
SERVICES) IN THE HOPE THAT LIBRARIANS AND UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS WILL USE
THE STATEMENT AS A MODEL FOR THEIR OWN COPYRIGHT PHOTOCOPYING POLICIES.
