LIBRARY DATA, STATISTICS AND INFORMATION' PROGRESS TOWARD COMPARABILITY.
     
LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS AND SIZES ARE INCREASINGLY BOUND BY COMMON NEEDS AND
CONCERNS. THIS SYMBIOSIS HAS PLACED NEW DEMANDS UPON THE COMMUNITY. PRIMARY
AMONG THESE IS THE DEMAND FOR COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS AND A LANGUAGE IN WHICH TO
SHARE THESE UNDERSTANDINGS. ONE AVENUE TO SUCH AN OBJECTIVE IS OUTLINED.
FOREMOST TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS A FRAMEWORK OF INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARIES. A
METHOD BY WHICH TO CATALOGUE THE IMPRESSIONS OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR AND FROM
WHICH TO MOVE TO SOME EMPIRICALLY BASED AND SOUND THEORY OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR
IS DESCRIBED.
