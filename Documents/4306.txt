CENTRAL STOCK ACQUISITION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN 1982.
     
THIS PRACTICE, CARRIED OUT BY THE CZECH MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND NOW WELL

REALISATION OF THE STATE CULTURAL POLICY. THE FUNDS ARE NOT SMALL; THE SUM
INVOLVED IS MORE THAN 3 MILLION CROWNS. THE SELECTION OF TITLES AND READERS
SERVICES CONCERNING THIS LITERATURE ARE EXPLAINED.
