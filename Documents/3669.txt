THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE.
     
PRESENT-DAY LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS,
POLITICS, AND TECHNOLOGY. ADEQUATE FUNDING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY WHILE LIBRARIANS
DO NOT ACT EFFECTIVELY IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY THREATENS
TO LEAD LIBRARIANS RATHER THAN FOLLOW. USING THE ANALOGY OF A BUSINESS OFFICE,
THE AUTHOR PROPOSES AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE WITH 3
COMPONENTS; THE LIBRARY, THE JOB, AND THE HOME.
