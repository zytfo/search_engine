THE 1ST ACADEMIC LIBRARY OF SIBERIA (THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARY OF THE TOMSK UNIVERSITY).

REVIEWS THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT AND DISCUSSES THE CURRENT WORK OF THE
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY OF TOMSK UNIVERSITY. WHEN FOUNDED, IN 1880, THE LIBRARY HAD
A STOCK OF APPROXIMATELY 96,000 ITEMS CONSISTING OF VALUABLE COLLECTIONS OF
BOOKS, WHICH WERE EITHER PURCHASED OR WHICH THE LIBRARY RECEIVED AS GIFTS.
INITIALLY THE USE WAS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE: DURING ITS FIRST 10 YEARS THE
LIBRARY HANDLED ON AVERAGE ONLY 5,000 LOANS PER YEAR. STAFF WORKED UNDER
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1941-44 WHEN A HERBARIUM AND
A MUSEUM WERE MOVED INTO ITS PREMISES. IN ADDITION, DURING THAT PERIOD THE
LIBRARY LOOKED AFTER THE ARCHIVES OF A.M. GOR'KII, L.N. TOLSTOI AND A.S.
PUSHKIN. DESPITE THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS, STAFF NOT ONLY MANAGED TO CONTINUE
THEIR WORK BUT THE LIBRARY ALSO PROVIDED A SERVICE TO WOUNDED SOLDIERS
RECEIVING TREATMENT IN TOMSK. THE LIBRARY HAS CURRENTLY A STOCK OF 3, 5
MILLION ITEMS IN MORE THAN 50 LANGUAGES AND AN EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF
PERIODICALS. IN 1969 THE LIBRARY BECAME A METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR 46
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. IT ORGANISES OVER 300 BOOK EXHIBITIONS A YEAR.
