THE DEVELOPMENT AND WORK OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
PATIENTS, AS BASED ON THE REGULATIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN THE GERMAN
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
LIBRARY WORK IS COORDINATED BY DISTRICT WORKING PARTIES, WITH SPECIAL GROUPS
SUPERVISING PATIENTS' LIBRARIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS WHERE BIBLIOTHERAPY
PLAYS A PROMINENT PART. CLOSE LINKS ARE MAINTAINED WITH DISTRICT MEDICAL
OFFICERS. SOME HOSPITALS ARE STILL WITHOUT PATIENTS' LIBRARIES AND EVERY
EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEDICAL
STAFF. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT STOCK THAT WILL ASSIST RECOVERY; REGULAR
DISCUSSIONS ARE HELD ON SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ARRANGEMENT AND APPEARANCE OF
PATIENTS' LIBRARIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; OLD HOSPITAL BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN
WITHOUT SUITABLE PREMISES FOR A LIBRARY. IN NEW BUILDINGS A LIBRARY ROOM IS
ALWAYS PROVIDED. IN MANY HOSPITALS THE PATIENTS' LIBRARY IS AMALGAMATED WITH
THE TRADE UNION LIBRARY, SO THAT EXTRA FINANCE AND STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.
