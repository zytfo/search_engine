A6 SIZE MICROFICHE FOR THE MOTOR INDUSTRY.

INTRODUCTION TO BRITISH STANDARDS BS 5956:1980. THE MOTOR INDUSTRY HAS, OVER
THE YEARS, GRADUALLY ADOPTED THE MICROFICHE FOR THE SUPPLY OF INFORMATION
RELATING TO SPECIFICATION AND SERVICE PARTS. A BRITISH STANDARD HAS NOW BEEN
PRODUCED, RECOMMENDING THE USE OF AN A6 MICROFICHE PRODUCED TO A 48X WITH A
TOTAL OF 270 LANDSCAPE IMAGES PER FICHE AS THE PREFERRED STANDARD, WITH AN
ALTERNATIVE OF 420 PORTRAIT IMAGES ALSO AT 48X. THE STANDARD IS RECOMMENDED
FOR INTRODUCTION BY ALL NEW USERS IN THE MOTOR INDUSTRY OF MICROFICHE SYSTEMS,
AND ALSO HAS A STRONG SUGGESTION THAT THOSE VEHICLE/ENGINE MANUFACTURERS WHO
ARE ALREADY USING A NON-STANDARD MICROFICHE SYSTEM CONSIDER CHANGING IN THE
VERY NEAR FUTURE.
