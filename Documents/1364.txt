BARCODING A COLLECTION-WHY, WHEN, AND HOW.

AS A SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES'
APPROACH TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS TO AIM FOR AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. IT WAS
DECIDED TO LABEL ALL ITEMS WITH MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFIERS AND ENTER THE
UNIQUE IDENTIFIER INTO THE DATA BASE AT THE TIME EACH RECORD WAS CREATED. THE
RATIONALE FOR THESE DECISIONS IS DISCUSSED. DIFFERENT TYPES OF
MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE REVIEWED. THE TYPE OF LABELS
CHOSEN AND THE PROCEDURES USED FOR LABELING ITEMS AND FOR ENTERING THE BARCODE
INFORMATION INTO THE MACHINE-READABLE RECORD ARE DISCUSSED.
