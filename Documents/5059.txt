LIBRARIES, RADIO AND TELEVISION IN WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE MEDIA CAN COOPERATE. RADIO
AND TELEVISION CAN BROADCAST RELEVANT PROGRAMMES SUCH AS DISCUSSIONS,
INTERVIEWS WITH AUTHORS AND STORY READINGS. LIBRARIANS CAN USE TELEVISION AND
RADIO TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON PARTICULAR ISSUES,
RECOMMENDING PROGRAMMES AND LINKING BOOK DISPLAYS TO THEM. ALTERNATIVELY,
LIBRARIANS CAN BE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROGRAMMES AND CAN
USE THEM TO PUBLICISE POPULAR LITERATURE AND AUTHORS. A SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN IN
ROSTOV, SHOWED HOW EFFECTIVE THIS FORM OF COOPERATION COULD BE, BUT IT IS
OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.
