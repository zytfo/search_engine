SCHOOL LIBRARIES-A DREAM OF THE 1970S.
     
EDUCATIONAL REFORM CANNOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE BASIC
CULTURAL TECHNOLOGY. PARTICULAR SUCCESS IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE 3
COMBINED SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN HANOVER, WHICH CONTAINS A WIDE RANGE
OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT FOR CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL STUDY AND FOR LEISURE
ACTIVITIES. IF PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
STOCKS ARE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO CENTRALISED PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THE
RIGHT TO FINANCIAL PROVISION MUST BE GUARANTEED. MORE CLARITY IS NEEDED
REGARDING THE CALCULATION OF PROCESSING COSTS; STAFFING COSTS SHOULD BE BORNE
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MATERIAL AND BINDING COSTS BY THE SCHOOLS. SOME PROBLEMS
CONCERNING THE ORGANISATION OF USE PROCEDURES, E.G. TICKET WRITING AND FINE
COLLECTION, REMAIN UNSOLVED.
