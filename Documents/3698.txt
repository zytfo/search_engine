MEDIA CONTROL REPORT WITHOUT PERSPECTIVES.
     
COMMENTS ON 2AUTOMATED MEDIA CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1A JOINT REPORT BY
THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS AND THE COMPUTER
COMMITTEE. THE WORKING PARTY ON PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT DELINEATE LONG-TERM
PERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS PROPOSALS AS PART
OF A WHOLE. THE SWEDISH SITUATION OF 2 SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESULTING IN DUPLICATION OF WORK AND UNDER-UTILISED
RESOURCES, MUST BE AVOIDED IN NORWAY; THE REPORT IS CRITICISED FOR NOT
CONSIDERING COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES TOGETHER. IT
ALSO FAILS TO SPECIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERISATION ON LIBRARY STAFFS,
BORROWERS AND FINANCE. THE COMMITTEE REGARDS ISSUE CONTROL AS THE ROUTINE MOST
REQUIRING COMPUTERISATION, BUT MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,
SUCH AS OVERDUE RECALL WORK. EASILY-AMASSED STATISTICS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO
BUILD UP EXTRA WORK. SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS FROM THE REPORT ARE SELECTED FOR
DETAILED COMMENT.
