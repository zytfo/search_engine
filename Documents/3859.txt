HOW DO LIBRARIES CATALOGUE.
     
THE WORKING GROUP ON CATALOGUING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEYED THE FINNISH
PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT CATALOGUING METHODS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. 461 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT AND 409 WERE RETURNED. THE WORKING
GROUP IS DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
JUST OVER 70% OF THE RESPONDENTS USE FINNISH CATALOGUING RULES. JUST UNDER 50%
OF THE RESPONDENTS USE THEIR OWN SUBJECT INDEXING AND NEARLY 87% OF THE
RESPONDENTS USE THE 1975 EDITION OF THE FINNISH CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON
DEWEY. OVER 50% USE THE CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICE OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY,
AND NEARLY 60% OF THE RESPONDING LIBRARY AUTHORITIES UNDERTAKE CENTRALISED
CATALOGUING.
