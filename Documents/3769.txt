MATCHING USER NEEDS IN HEALTH CARE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS
AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, 22-25 SEPT 81. OUTLINES THE PATTERN OF
LIBRARY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO STAFF IN THE UK NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (N.H.S.)
AND GIVES A PRELIMINARY REPORT OF A STUDY OF LIBRARY USAGE AND OF ATTITUDES
TOWARD LIBRARIES AMONG CLINICAL AND PRE-CLINICAL STAFF AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S. STAFF ARE NUMEROUS BUT SMALL, MOST COMMONLY BEING
STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN, AND RECEIVE LITTLE PUBLICITY. IN SPITE OF THEIR
SMALL SIZE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HAVE A 'SPECIAL LIBRARY' CHARACTER. TEACHING
HOSPITAL LIBRARIES REPRESENT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE
N.H.S. LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND ARE THE LARGEST OF THE LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S.
STAFF. DATA ON USAGE AND ATTITUDES WERE COLLECTED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS
IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS WOULD GIVE A RICHER PICTURE THAN WOULD BE
PROVIDED BY ANY ONE OF CONVENTIONAL SURVEY TECHNIQ UES. DISCUSSES THE USE OF
MODELLING METHODS FOR INTERPRETING DATA.
