SOME ASPECTS OF TECHNICAL REPORT PROCESSING BY FEDERAL AGENCIES.

TECHNICAL REPORTS ARE A VALUABLE RESOURCE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIP INTO LESS THAN MAXIMUM UTILITY.
WHILE THE PROCESSING OF MORE TRADITIONAL INFORMATION SOURCES HAS PROGRESSED
AND REMARKABLY IMPROVED THROUGH SUCH MECHANISMS AS SHARED CATALOGUING AND
ON-LINE ACCESS TO HUGE FILES OF CATALOGUING DATA, THE CORRESPONDING PROCESSING
OF TECHNICAL REPORTS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STAGNANT. SOME EFFORTS AT
COORDINATING THE PROCESSING OF REPORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE 4 US FEDERAL
AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST REPORT COLLECTIONS. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS
SUGGESTED INCLUDE STUDY OF A COMMON REPORT FORMAT, MORE EXTENSIVE SHARED
PROCESSING OF FEDERAL DOCUMENTS AND INCREASED EFFORTS TOWARDS COOPERATION IN
THE FEDERAL LIBRARY NETWORK.
