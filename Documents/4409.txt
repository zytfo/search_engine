SOME THOUGHTS ON NATIONAL RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
AN EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1981 IFLA CONFERENCE IN LEIPZIG
DISCUSSING THE PROBLEMS OF RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND THE AUTHOR'S OWN
APPROACH, IN RELATION TO THE IFLA RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY PROGRAMMES.
EXAMINES WHAT CONSTITUTES A RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY, AND THEN CONSIDERS THE
PARTICULAR PROBLEMS RELATING TO THOSE NOT LINKED TO CURRENT NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, BOTH IN COUNTRIES WITH A LONG PUBLISHING TRADITION AND IN
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES; THE PRODUCTION OF RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES IS THEN DISCUSSED; DESCRIBES
TECHNIQUES AND RESOURCES FOR CONSTRUCTING BOTH KINDS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND
PROBLEMS OF ORGANISATION.
