SOME FEATURES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH LIBRARY BOOK STOCKS WITHIN A
REGION.

OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID GROWTH BOTH IN THE NUMBERS OF
LIBRARIES AND IN THE SIZE OF THEIR STOCKS. BELORUSSIA PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS AND ITS STATISTICS CAN BE FAVOURABLY COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE USSR AS A
WHOLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES INTO COOPERATIVE NETWORKS NECESSITATED
SPECIALISATION IN BOOK SELECTION, BUT THERE WAS FOUND TO BE LITTLE VALUE IN
SMALL LIBRARIES SPECIALISING WHILE ALL THE LARGER ONES MAINTAINED UNIVERSAL
STOCKS. VARIOUS METHODS OF PROFILING WERE USED TO AVOID THIS.
