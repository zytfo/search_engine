COMPARISON OF RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS DATA BASE IN
SEARCHES PERFORMED THROUGH DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST.

REPORT OF RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT THE SPANISH NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE (CENIDOC). IDENTICAL SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED THROUGH
THE DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST SYSTEMS, USING 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 (CA), FOR EQUAL
LENGTHS OF TIME. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE INITIAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS TO
EXPLAIN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN REFERENCES RETRIEVED, AND THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CA FILE. RESULTS OBTAINED USING A WIDE VARIETY OF SEARCH
CRITERIA ARE PRESENTED. THE SYSTEMS AGREED ONLY WHEN REGISTRATION NUMBERS OR
PERIODICAL CODES WERE USED, AND MORE INFORMATION WAS ALWAYS OBTAINED THROUGH
DIALOG USING INDEXING TERMS. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THAT QUEST DOES NOT USE
THE COMPLETE CA SEARCH, AND DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ITS LIMITATIONS.
