IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN BRAZIL.
     
PRESENTS THE CONCLUSIONS OF A PAPER GIVEN AT A BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON LITERATURE
FOR CHILDREN IN 1978. 21 CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORS WERE EXAMINED,
AND FOUND TO BE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO A RIGID PREDETERMINED STRUCTURE BASED ON
A CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE DEMARCATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, BACKED BY AN IDEOLOGY
LEGITIMISING THE POWER OF ADULTS OVER CHILDREN. DRAWS A PARALLEL WITH THE
SUBLITERATURE OF 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, AND POSTULATES THAT BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRODUCT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
ORDER, REFLECTING IN THE DEPICTION OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP THE
PRODUCER-CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SUPERFICIALLY CONTEMPORARY MATERIAL IN LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL DETAIL DOES NOT
AFFECT THE ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY CHARACTER OF SUCH WORKS, AND THIS
IDEOLOGICAL RIGIDITY EXPLAINS THEIR LOW LITERARY QUALITY.
