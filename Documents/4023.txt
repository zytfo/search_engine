PRESENT STATUS OF INORGANIC CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE.
     
A SYSTEMATIC CHEMICAL NAME IS ONE WHICH PORTRAYS THE ESSENTIAL STRUCTURAL
FEATURES OF A CHEMICAL COMPOUND BY SOME GENERAL PATTERN. FOR MOST PURPOSES IT
IS UNNECESSARY TO WRITE NOMENCLATURE RULES IN SUCH DETAIL AS TO PROVIDE A
SINGLE NAME FOR EACH COMPOUND. LIKE ALL HUMAN ACTIVITIES NOMENCLATURE PATTERNS
CHANGE WITH TIME. THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS, TO SECURE GREATER
GENERALITY, OR TO OBTAIN SIMPLER NAMES. WHILE NOMENCLATURE SPECIALISTS MUST BE
ATTUNED TO THE NEEDS OF NOMENCLATURE USERS, THEIR SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS TO BE
SUCCESSFUL MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE USERS. THE PRESENTATION DETAILS WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY (1) THE COMMITTEE-COMMISSION
STRUCTURE IN THIS COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY, (2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
IN THE PAST HALF-CENTURY, (3) DEVELOPMENTS IN PROGRESS, AND (4) AREAS WHERE
NOMENCLATURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE NEEDED.
