LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AND GRADUATE STUDENTS' MORE WORK FOR GEORGE.
     
RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF FACULTY MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT KANSAS
CITY'S SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION, INTO THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS LIBRARY
INSTRUCTION FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS, ARE PRESENTED. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY
SKILLS ARE INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE THE LONGER THE STUDENTS REMAIN IN SCHOOL,
THAT STUDENTS MAY PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY
RESEARCH SKILLS THAN DO THEIR INSTRUCTORS AND FINALLY, THAT LIBRARIANS CAN
UTILISE STUDENTS' SELF-EVALUATIONS OF RESOURCE SKILLS TO CONVINCE FACULTY OF
THE NEED FOR MORE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL.
