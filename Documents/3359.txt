OCLC'S DATABASE CONVERSION' A USER'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE OF A LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WITH HEADINGS IN THE OCLC
DATA BASE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO AACR2 FORM. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE USE OF
LC AUTHORITY RECORDS IN THE DATA BASE. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED,
INCLUDING SOME RESULTING FROM LC PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRESENCE OF THE
AUTHORITY RECORDS, AND ESPECIALLY THE CONVERSION OF ABOUT 40% OF THE HEADINGS
IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, HAS BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE LIBRARY,
SIGNIFICANTLY SPEEDING UP THE CATALOGUING OPERATION.
