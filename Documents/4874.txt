THE READING LIBRARIES WERE FORERUNNERS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY; THEY WERE
FOUNDED IN THE 18TH CENTURY, AT THE TIME OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, AS
PROFIT-MAKING INSTITUTIONS BY MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE CATALOGUE OF 1 SUCH LIBRARY, DIE ARNOLDSCHE

GERMANY AND ABROAD, OF WHICH SOME WORKS HAVE NOW BECOME CLASSICS. THE FICTION

CHIVALRY AND THE SUPERNATURAL. THERE WERE ALSO ABOUT 400 DRAMATIC WORKS AND
100 ON TRAVEL AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORY.
