SURVEY OF CZECH AND SLOVAK PERIODICALS AND BULLETINS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND
INFORMATICS.

MORE THAN 20 PERIODICALS, NEWSLETTERS AND OTHER PAPERS DEALING WITH THE THEORY
AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ARE LISTED. THE SLOVAK
CITATEL' AND ITS CZECH COUNTERPART CTENAR NOW CATER FOR LIBRARIES IN GENERAL.
ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN MIND. OTHER PERIODICALS
ARE MORE SPECIALISED, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMIC LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN INDUSTRY; IN UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
ESTABLISHMENTS. THEIR EDITORIAL STAFF MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO IMPART INFORMATION
TO THEIR READERS, NOT ONLY ON LIBRARY ROUTINES AND TECHNIQUES, BUT ALSO SOME
INSIGHT INTO THE READERS PSYCHOLOGY, THE SITUATION IN A SIMILAR FIELD ABROAD,
THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS, IMPORTANT EVENTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE LIKE. A
SPECIAL NEWSLETTER TAKES UP CONSTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS , THEIR
FURNISHING AND EQUIPMENT, BOOK COLLECTIONS AND CATALOGUING. ALTHOUGH SLOVAK
TRADE UNIONS AS WELL AS MUSEUM AND AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES STILL LACK
PERIODICALS OF THEIR OWN, THE CHOICE IS WIDE AND NO LIBRARIAN AND/OR
INFORMATION SCIENTIST NEED BE BEHIND THE TIMES.
