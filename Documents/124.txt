LIBRARY CENSORSHIP AND THE PERMISSIVE MINORITY.

RE-ANALYSES A NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF US ADULTS CONDUCTED IN 1970 FOR THE
COMMISSION ON OBSCENITY AND PORNOGRAPHY TO PERMIT NEW COMPARISONS OF THE LARGE
MAJORITY WHO FAVOURED LIBRARY CENSORSHIP OF 'EROTICA' WITH THE MINORITY WHO
OPPOSED IT. AS EXPECTED FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS-FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OPPOSING CENSORSHIP WERE
YOUNGER, BETTER EDUCATED, MORE OPEN TO MASS MEDIA, AND BY A NUMBER OF
MEASURES, MORE LIBERAL OR PERMISSIVE. THE ANTICENSORSHIP POSITION APPEARS TO
BE PART OF A GENERAL LIBERAL IDEOLOGY THAT EXTENDS TO SUCH ISSUES AS RACIAL
INTEGRATION AND EVNIRONMENTALISM. FURTHER, THE ANTICENSORSHIP GROUP HAS MUCH
IN COMMON WITH THE GROUP IDENTIFIED BY OTHER STUDIES AS USERS OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
