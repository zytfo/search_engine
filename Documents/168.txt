THE LEGAL STATUS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE RHINELAND PALATINATE.

THE 1978 RHINELAND PALATINATE STATE LAW ON UNIVERSITIES HAS MADE THE POSITION
OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT WAS UNDER THE 1970 LAW WITH
REGARD TO THEIR SPHERES OF COMPETENCE. CURRENT LEGISLATION IS PARTICULARLY
VAGUE ABOUT WHO SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS, THE RIGHTS OF THE
VARIOUS UNIVERSITY BODIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER. DETAILED
ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE 1978 LAW AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE LIBRARY, THE LEGAL
POSITION OF THE LIBRARY, ITS DIRECTOR AND THE SENATE AND OF INDIVIDUAL LEGAL
PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE AUTHORITY FOR STOCK PURCHASE, CONTROL OF STAFFING AND
FINANCE, DECISIONS ON STAFFING MADE BY THE SENATE PRESIDENT, THE LIBRARY'S
TASKS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY AND LEGAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND OTHER
UNIVERSITY BODIES. THIS ANALYSIS COULD PROVE HELPFUL TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
IN OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR LAWS.
