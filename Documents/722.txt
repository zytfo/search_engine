LEGAL INFORMATION FROM EUROPEAN DOCUMENTATION CENTRES.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES HAS ESTABLISHED A NUMBER OF
EUROPEAN DOCUMENTATION CENTRES AND DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES IN THE UK AND
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHICH CONTAIN COLLECTIONS OF THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS OF
THE EEC. DESPITE DIFFICULTIES IN THE ACQUISITION AND EXPLOITATION OF THESE
MATERIALS THERE IS MUCH OF INTEREST TO LAW LIBRARIES.
