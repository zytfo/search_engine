THE FINNISH PERIODICALS INDEX IS UNDERGOING CHANGES.

THE PRINTED VERSION OF THE FINNISH PERIODICALS INDEX COVERS 1957-77. IN
ADDITION THERE IS A RETROSPECTIVE INDEX FOR 1803-63. THE CURRENT INDEX IS NOW
PROCESSED BY A COMPUTER. THE INDEX IS SELECTIVE BOTH IN ITS COVERAGE OF
PERIODICALS AND PERIODICAL ARTICLES. UDC HAS BEEN USED SINCE COMPUTERISATION.
BECAUSE OF COMPUTERISATION THE PRESENTATION HAS SUFFERED. THERE ARE PLANS TO
DECENTRALISE THE INDEXING, WHICH UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE LIBRARY
OF TURKU UNIVERSITY, AND TO EXPAND THE COVERAGE.
