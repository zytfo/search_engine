THE PRODUCTION STIMULATING FACTORY LIBRARY IN WEST GERMANY.
     
DESPITE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY, PRIVATE WORKPLACE
LIBRARIES REMAIN IMPORTANT. THERE ARE 250 OF THESE WITH 1 1/2 MILLION VOLUMES
SERVING 800,000 EMPLOYEES. AN INVESTIGATION IN 1974 BY KONJETZKY AND PLOETZ
REVEALED AN ILLIBERAL BIAS IN BOOK SELECTION. THE FACTORY LIBRARIANS'
ORGANISATION JUSTIFIES THE LIBRARY BY ITS USEFULNESS TO THE FIRM AND REFERS TO
AN ARTICLE BY MUTH (THE READER AS A FACTOR OF PRODUCTIVITY IN THE FIRM), IN
WHICH HE ARGUES THAT THE AIM OF THE LIBRARY IS TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN THE
ABILITY TO READ, AS EFFICIENT READERS MEAN WORKERS WITH HIGH MOBILITY, AND
MONEY SPENT ON LIBRARIES IS LIKELY TO YIELD A HIGH RETURN.
