ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND INNOVATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 4 NORTH AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO ASSESS
JERALD HAGE AND MICHAEL AIKEN'S THEORY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
STRUCTURAL VARIABLE COMPLEXITY AND RATE OF INNOVATION IS POSITIVE AND THAT IT
IS NEGATIVE FOR CENTRALISATION, FORMALISATION, AND STRATIFICATION. FINDINGS
SUPPORT THE THEORY AND THE METHODOLOGY, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS, WAS SHOWN TO
BE TRANSFERABLE.
