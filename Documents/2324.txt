IF ONLY THEY HAD A TELEPHONE...'.A
     
RGUES THAT MUCH REFERENCE WORK IS BASED ON INADEQUATE AND OUTDATED REFERENCE
MATERIAL LEADING TO WRONG ANSWERS TO QUERIES. FOR THIS REASON A PROJECT AIMED
AT BUILDING UP A REGIONAL INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE REGIONAL LIBRARY IN KALMAR
WAS INITIATED. THE AIM WAS TO ACHIEVE A WELL SELECTED REFERENCE STOCK IN ALL
LIBRARIES ACCORDING TO SIZE AND NEED, EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE AIDS AND OF THE
REGIONAL LIBRARY'S REFERENCE SECTION. A PRECONDITION OF THIS IS A WELL
FUNCTIONING TELEPHONE SERVICE. IN ORDER TO COORDINATE AND IMPROVE INFORMATION
SUPPLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL, PLANS SHOULD BE MADE FOR INFORMATION ACTIVITY WITHIN
A MUNICIPALITY AND REGION WHICH INCLUDE TRAINING OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS, AND
THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE MORE WIDELY ADVERTISED AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION.
