THE WAR OF AACR 2: VICTORS OR VICTIMS?.

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION)-AACR 2-PROVIDE A CASE STUDY
OF ACHIEVEMENT, CONTROVERSY, AND FAILURE. WHILE PROPONENTS APPLAUD THE
'INTERNAL HARMONY' OF AACR 2, OBSERVERS NOTE THE SACRIFICES ALREADY MADE TO
TRANSATLANTIC EXPENDIENTS AND CRITICS SEEK TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. DISCUSSES
THE REVISION OF AACR AND EXPLORES THE ACTIONS AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES OF VARIOUS
PARTICIPANTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONFLICT. THE LACK OF
SUPPORT FOR AACR 2 CAN BE EXPLAINED PARTIALLY BY THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, THE DIFFICULTY OF JUSTIFYING ITS BENEFITS, AND THE
FEELING THAT IT INTRUDES ON MORE IMPORTANT LOCAL PRIORITIES. MAKES SOME
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEXT AACR REVISION.
