LABORATORY NOTEBOOK STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

DESPITE THE GENERAL CONCLUSION THAT LABORATORY NOTEBOOKS CONTAIN VALUABLE AND
OFTEN NEEDED DATA, THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE DISCUSSION IN THE
LITERATURE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADEQUATE STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR
THEM. TO DETERMINE THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM, A SURVEY OF 83
FOOD SCIENCE LIBRARIES WAS CONDUCTED. 60% OF THE LIBRARIES EMPLOYED SOME KIND
OF A SYSTEM. 4 DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WERE IDENTIFIED; AND THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED
ACCESS BY NOTEBOOK AUTHOR AND NOTEBOOK ACCESSION NUMBER WAS PREDOMINANT.
