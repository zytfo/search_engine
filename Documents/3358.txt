AACR2' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION AND DATABASE CONVERSION.
     
OCLC'S ONLINE UNION CATALOG (OLUC) CONTAINS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS CREATED
UNDER VARIOUS CATALOGUING GUIDELINES. UNTIL DEC 80, NO SYSTEM-WIDE ATTEMPT HAD
BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE RECORD CONFLICTS CAUSED BY USE OF THE DIFFERENT
GUIDELINES. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES, AACR2, EXACERBATED THESE
RECORD CONFLICTS. TO REDUCE LIBRARY COSTS, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE DRAMATICALLY
AS USERS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THOSE CONFLICTS, OCLC CONVERTED NAME HEADINGS
AND UNIFORM TITLES IN ITS DATA BASE TO AACR2 FORM.
