COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFORM LIBRARY CATALOG' A SURVEY.

THIS DISCUSSION OF THE USE OF COM AS A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE LIBRARY
CARD CATALOGUE INCLUDES A BRIEF HISTORY OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES AND OF MICROFORM
TECHNOLOGY SINCE WORLD WAR II. IT IS ARGUED THAT COM CATALOGUEES ARE TO BE
PREFERRED TO CARD CATALOGUES, ON-LINE CATALOGUES ACCESSED BY TERMINALS, AND
PAPER PRINTOUTS. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FILM OR FICHE FORMATS FOR A
LIBRARY CATALOGUE ARE EXPLORED IN RELATION TO RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE, COST, AND
EASE OF USE, AND SUCH FEATURES AS UPDATING PROCEDURES, READABILITY, AND
POSSIBLE PATRON RELUCTANCE TO USE COM ARE DISCUSSED IN GREATER DEPTH. IT IS
CONCLUDED THAT COM APPEARS TO BE THE MOST VIABLE ANSWER TO NEW DEMANDS PLACED
ON THE LIBRARY CATALOGUE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
