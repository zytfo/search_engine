THE FEDERAL SIDE OF TRADITIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COST ALLOCATIONS.
     
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS BEFORE THE 96TH CONGRESS, THE
STRUCTURE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS BEING DEBATED IN NUMEROUS
REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, COURT CASES, ETC. CENTRAL TO THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE
'PROPER COSTS' AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS NOT ONLY TO PRICES BUT ALSO TO OTHER
BENEFITS OR BURDENS. COSTS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE TRADITIONAL
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY MAINLY BY A 2-STAGE PROCESS. 1ST, EXPLICIT
JURISDICTIONAL SEPARATIONS HAVE ALLOCATED COSTS HENCE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS
AMONG THE FEDERAL AND ALL THE STATE JURISDICTIONS. 2ND, PRICING RATHER THAN
COSTING POLICY HAS DETERMINED THE FURTHER INCIDENCE OF BENEFITS AND BURDENS IN
THE GENERAL ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT SUBALLOCATIONS OF COSTS WITHIN THE POOLS OF
COSTS ASSIGNED TO THE BROAD AGGREGATES OF INTERSTATE AND STATE SERVICES.
