LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN AUSTRALIA' THE STATE OF THE ART.

BOTH THE 14.5 MILLION POPULATION AND THE DISTANCE WHICH AUSTRALIA IS FROM THE
MAJOR PUBLISHING CENTRES MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTHUSIASM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY.
AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES WERE EARLY USERS OF MICROCOMPUTERS. A GROWTH IN THE
COUNTRY'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS HAS CULMINATED IN THE INTRODUCTION OF MIDAS IN
79, AND USE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES VIA LOCKHEED, SDC AND OCLC. ACCESS TO DATA
BASES WITHIN AUSTRALIA IS NOW ACHIEVED THROUGH AUSINET AND CSIRONET. THIS HAS
PROMOTED LIBRARY AUTOMATION, DEALT WITH HERE IN 3 PHASES' (1) RELATES TO
PUNCHED-CARD SYSTEMS; (2) IS CHARACTERISED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AUSMARC IN
71, AND THE AUSTRALIAN MARC RECORD SERVICE; AND (3) COVERS THE SHARED SYSTEMS
AND COOPERATIVE NETWORKS. BRIEFLY SURVEYS THE FUTURE WHICH SEEMS LARGELY
DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMME FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE A NATIONWIDE SERVICE.
