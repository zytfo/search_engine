A GENERAL MODEL OF QUERY PROCESSING IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
MOST CURRENT DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS REQUIRE THAT USER QUERIES BE SPECIFIED
IN THE FORM OF BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS. ALTHOUGH BOOLEAN QUERIES WORK, THEY HAVE
FLAWS. SOME OF THE ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THESE FLAWS HAVE INVOLVED
'PARTIAL-MATCH' RETRIEVAL OR THE USE OF FUZZY-SUBSET THEORY. RECENTLY, SOME
GENERALISATIONS OF FUZZY-SUBSET THEORY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WOULD ALLOW
THE USER TO SPECIFY QUERIES WITH RELEVANCE WEIGHTS OR THRESHOLDS ATTACHED TO
TERMS. THE VARIOUS QUERY-PROCESSING METHODS ARE DISCUSSED AND COMPARED.
