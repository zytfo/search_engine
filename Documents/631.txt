SOME REFLECTIONS ON CITATION HABITS IN PSYCHOLOGY.

CITATIONS APPEARING IN THE PAGES OF A SINGLE JOURNAL, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL
PSYCHOLOGY, WERE COUNTED FOR THE YEARS 1960-1979. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED
WITH THOSE FOUND BY USING NETWORKS OF JOURNALS AND WITH THE NUMBER OF
ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS DURING THE SAME PERIOD. IN BOTH
CASES THE RESULTS TEND TO SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITATION HABITS
AND THE VOLUME OF LITERATURE AVAILABLE FOR CITING IS NOT VERY CLOSE.
