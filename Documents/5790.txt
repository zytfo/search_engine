USER EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES.

THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN SHOULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN THE TEACHING OF INFORMATION
AND RESEARCH SKILLS TO PUPILS WITHOUT SUBJECT BIAS. GETTING TO KNOW PUPILS IS
IMPORTANT SO THAT THE APPROPRIATE SERVICE CAN BE OFFERED. REGULAR LIBRARY
VISITS FOR 1ST-YEAR PUPILS ARE ESPECIALLY VALUABLE AND ARE BEST DONE BY
TIMETABLING A LIBRARY LESSON THAT IS NOT ATTACHED TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT
AREA. THEREAFTER VISITS CAN BE ORGANISED AS REQUIRED BUT THE NEED FOR A MORE
STRUCTURED APPROACH IS OFTEN FELT BY THE START OF THE 4TH YEAR. IT IS
IMPORTANT TOO THAT THE TEACHING STAFF HAVE RESEARCH AND INFORMATION SKILLS AND
THESE CAN BE DEVELOPED BY THE LIBRARIAN.
