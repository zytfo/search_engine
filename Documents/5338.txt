A READER'S VIEW OF EAST ASIAN CATALOGUE AUTOMATION.

DISCUSSES WHETHER AUTOMATION IS PREFERABLE FOR CATALOGUES OF CHINESE LANGUAGE
MATERIALS IN AUSTRALIA. PRESENTS A BRIEF HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION IN CHINA. THE ROMANISED CATALOGUE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER IS MOST
SUITED TO AUTOMATION BUT A SUPPLEMENTARY CHARACTER-BASED CATALOGUE FOR LARGE
EAST ASIAN HOLDINGS WOULD HELP USERS MORE FAMILIAR WITH CHARACTERS AND WITH
DIFFERENT PRONUNCIATIONS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS. SUGGESTS THAT
LIBRARIANS SHOULD HOLD BACK AUTOMATION UNTIL AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHICH CAN
COPE WITH BOTH ROMANISED AND CHARACTER DATA AT A REASONABLE COST IS DEVELOPED
AND THEN AIM FOR A CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR ALL EAST ASIAN MATERIALS
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, POSSIBLY BASED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA BUT
WITH INPUT FROM ALL LIBRARIES WITH EAST ASIAN MATERIALS.
