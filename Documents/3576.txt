HISTORY OF THE KFAR GIL'ADI LIBRARY-A CASE STUDY OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES (IN
HEBREW).
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF KFAR GIL'ADI'S LIBRARY, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
DEVELOPMENT WAS SIMILAR IN OTHER VETERAN KIBBUTZIM. IT IS BASED MOSTLY ON ORAL
AND WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION-A LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH HAIM YISRAELI, FOUNDER OF
THE LIBRARY, MINUTES OF KIBBUTZ GENERAL MEETINGS AND WRITTEN REPORTS BY
LIBRARIANS. WHEN YISRAELI ARRIVED IN KFAR GIL'ADI IN 1934 HE FOUND ABOUT 250
BOOKS. TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE HE VOLUNTARILY ORGANISED THE COLLECTION AND
ENHANCED IT SO THAT IN 1938 IT CONTAINED 10,000 VOLUMES AND BECAME AN
IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ MEMBERS. TODAY THE
LIBRARY IS NO LONGER A CULTURAL CENTRE AND THE COLLECTION DOES NOT MEET THE
NEEDS OF THE MEMBERS. DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE LIBRARY COULD ONCE MORE
BECOME AN IMPORTANT CENTRE FOR THE COMMUNITY.
