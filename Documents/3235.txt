INFORMATION USE BY TEACHERS IN A JUNIOR SCHOOL.
     
THE PROBLEM OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN EDUCATION
DERIVES IN PART FROM A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TEACHERS USE EDUCATIONAL
INFORMATION IN PRACTICE. A CASE STUDY OF THE STAFF OF 1 JUNIOR SCHOOL WAS SET
UP TO COLLECT DETAILED EVIDENCE ON INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS' INFORMATION USE, THE
INFORMAL FLOW OF INFORMATION BETWEEN TEACHERS, AND THE IMPACT OF NEW
INFORMATION ON BOTH SCHOOL AND TEACHER. ALTHOUGH STILL IN PROGRESS, THE
ANALYSIS HAS SO FAR PRODUCED A PRELIMINARY MODEL OF THE UTILISATION PROCESS IN
THE SCHOOL, INDICATING ITS COMPLEXITY AND THE RANGE OF FACTORS INVOLVED.
