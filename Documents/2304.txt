BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS IN BUSINESS LIBRARIES.
     
RECENT ARTICLES HAVE DISCUSSED THE BUSINESS STUDENT'S LACK OF SKILL IN USING
THE LIBRARY AND THE NEED FOR LIBRARIANS AND TEACHING FACULTY TO BECOME
INVOLVED IN PREPARING THESE FUTURE BUSINESS LEADERS TO DO LIBRARY-CENTRED
RESEARCH. A SURVEY OF 120 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY USEFUL
AND EFFECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION METHODS. NEARLY 50% OF THE RESPONDENTS
FELT THAT TEACHING LIBRARY USE IN CONNECTION WITH A REGULAR COURSE IN THE
CURRICULUM WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION. OF THOSE
RESPONDING, 88% OF THE LIBRARIES ARE USING THIS METHOD.
