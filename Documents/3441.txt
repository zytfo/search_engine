AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF SUBSTITUTING 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1
ON-LINE FOR THE PRINTED COPY IN A MEDIUM-SIZED MEDICAL LIBRARY.
     
IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER A MORE ECONOMICAL AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROVIDING THE
INFORMATION IN THE PRINTED 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1, THE REFERENCE STAFF OF THE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI) SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY
DESIGNED A STUDY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE ON-LINE VERSION COULD BE SUBSTITUTED
FOR THE PRINTED. FOR 13 WEEKS, PATRONS USING THE PRINTED INDEX WERE OFFERED A
FREE COMPUTER SEARCH IN EXCHANGE FOR EVALUATING THE SEARCH. ONLY 39.6%
ACCEPTED AND 62% OF THESE STILL PLANNED TO REFER TO THE ABSTRACTS LATER, WHICH
ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE PRINTED VERSION. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ON-LINE
VERSION COULD BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PRINTED INDEX WAS THUS NOT CONFIRMED.
