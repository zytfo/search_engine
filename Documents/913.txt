COMMUNICATION WITH AN OCLC MODEL 100 TERMINAL.

THE OCLC MODEL 100 COMPUTER TERMINAL WAS DESIGNED ORIGINALLY TO BE USED IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OCLC (ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER) ON-LINE CATALOGUING
SYSTEM. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS THE USE OF THE TERMINAL FOR OTHER, MORE
LOCALISED, COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AS A USER INTERFACE. THE STUDY SHOWS HOW THE
2 MAIN DISADVANTAGES OF THE TERMINAL; NON-STANDARD COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL AND
NON-STANDARD CHARACTER SET WERE OVERCOME.
