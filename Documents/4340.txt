RECENT INCREASES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY READERSHIP AND LOANS DEMAND MORE
RATIONALISATION. THE LIMBA PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH THE PRODUCTION BY
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING OF GUARD CATALOGUES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THE BOOK
FORM BEING CONSIDERED MORE COMPACT AND PORTABLE THAN CARD FILES. EACH VOLUME
IS PLANNED IN 3 SECTIONS, NAMELY' SCIENCE AND OTHER NON-FICTION; FICTION; AND

LARGE BRANCH LIBRARIES, WILL BE KEPT UP TO DATE BY THE PUBLICATION OF
CUMULATIVE SUPPLEMENTS EVERY 6 MONTHS. NEW COMPLETE EDITIONS ARE PLANNED EVERY
2 YEARS. THE BOOK CATALOGUES ARE INTENDED TO REPLACE CARD CATALOGUES IN
BRANCHES, SMALL MUNICIPAL AND RURAL LIBRARIES AND IN TRADE UNION LIBRARIES.
