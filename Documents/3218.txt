THE MODERNIZATION OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
     
CHINA HAS SUFFERED FROM OVER A DECADE OF TURMOIL WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INFORMATION SERVICES. PRESENT POLICY STRESSES THE ROLE
OF INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. APART FROM
TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS, CHINA FACES A SERIOUS HANDICAP WITH ITS
UNIQUE WRITTEN LANGUAGE, WHERE THE 5000 PLUS CHARACTERS NEEDED TO EXPRESS
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONCEPTS ARE TOO LARGE TO BE HANDLED COST-EFFECTIVELY
BY PRESENT COMPUTERS. THIS REPORT OUTLINES WAYS IN WHICH CHINA IS CURRENTLY
ATTEMPTING TO MEET THESE PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE FOR MODERN INFORMATION SERVICES
BY THE END OF THE DECADE.
