JOURNALS READ BY ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, 1973 AND 1978.
     
A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF PROFESSIONAL
JOURNAL READING BEING DONE BY ACRL (ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH
LIBRARIES) ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, WITH DATA DRAWN FROM 2 SEPARATE SURVEYS MADE
OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO A SAMPLE OF ACRL
MEMBERS IN 1973 AND AGAIN IN 1978, WHICH ASCERTAINED HOW MANY JOURNALS THEY
WERE READING REGULARLY AND WHAT THE TITLES OF THOSE JOURNALS WERE.
ILLUSTRATIONS PROVIDE A COMPARISON OF MOST FREQUENTLY READ TITLES FOR 1973 TO
1978, WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF READER RESPONSE FOR EACH TITLE. FOR BOTH YEARS
SURVEYED, ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 7 JOURNALS READ ON A
REGULAR BASIS. A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 DATA INDICATED THAT 7 OF THE
TITLES CITED AS BEING READ ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF THE JOURNAL READING. AS HAD
BEEN THE CASE IN 1973, MORE THAN 9 IN 10 OF THESE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WERE
REGULAR READERS OF COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRAR IES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OTHER
TITLES HEAVILY CITED IN 1973 LOST READERSHIP AMONG ACRL MEMBERS DUE TO THE
DRAMATIC APPEARANCE OF THE JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP.
