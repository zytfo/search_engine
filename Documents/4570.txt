TIMES EDUCATION IN MALI WAS PROVIDED WITHIN THE FAMILY; IN THE COLONIAL
PERIODS, THE MEDIAEVAL BERBERS AND 19TH CENTURY FRENCH ESTABLISHED SOME
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. BETWEEN 1960 AND 1980, AFTER INDEPENDENCE, THE
EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS REFORMED AND A LITERACY CAMPAIGN PROMOTED IN THE
COUNTRY'S 4 MAIN LANGUAGES. SINCE THE 1970S 46 PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN
OPENED, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. KEYPOINTS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES ARE THE PRODUCTION OF SUITABLE LITERATURE,
STOCK EXPANSION AND STAFF TRAINING, A PROGRAMME COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BAMAKO. LIBRARIANS, AUTHORS AND
PUBLISHERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL LEGENDS AND
STORIES, ORGANISE CULTURAL EVENTS AND ENCOURAGE LIBRARY USE.
