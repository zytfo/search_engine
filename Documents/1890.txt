SPACE UTILIZATION AND ACCESS PATH LENGTH IN B-TREES.
     
B-TREES (BALANCED TREES) ARE USED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF VERY LARGE INDEXES. A
STATE VECTOR AND SYSTEM OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOUR OF
STATE CHANGES, FORM A DETERMINISTIC MODEL OF THE STATIC PROPERTIES. A UNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION OF KEYS IS ASSUMED. STATIC PROPERTIES, OPERATIONS ON B-TREES, AND
OVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW TREATMENT ARE DEFINED. A BASIC MODEL OF B-TREES IS USED
TO MODEL SPACE UTILISATION AND PATH LENGTH WHICH IS THEN APPLIED TO THE
TREATMENT OF UNDERFLOW AND OVERFLOW IN B-TREE ORGANISATION.
