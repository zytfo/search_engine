AUTOMATION IN AUSTRIAN LIBRARIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. DESCRIBES AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM ADOPTED BY THE GRAZ
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, SELECTED TO CARRY OUT AN AUTOMATION PROJECT BEFORE THE
INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN OTHER AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIES
ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEM
COMPRISES A COMPUTERISED ISSUE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LIGHT PEN AND ON-LINE
CATALOGUING AND SEARCHING. WHEN THE SYSTEM BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL
THROUGHOUT ALL LIBRARIES CONCERNED, THE NETWORK WILL BE DIVIDED BY REGIONS
INTO SMALLER UNITS AND EACH LIBRARY WILL HAVE ITS MINICOMPUTER. USER SERVICES
WILL BE IMPROVED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THROUGH THE LARGE
INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES.
