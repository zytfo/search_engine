MOON AND ITS READERS.
     
THE MOON SYSTEM FOR THE BLIND IS MORE EASILY LEARNT AND READ THAN BRAILLE, AND
IS STILL THE ONLY READING SYSTEM USED BY SOME 600 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND. MOON READERS SHOW MORE INTEREST IN OLDER LIGHT
FICTIONAL WORKS THAN IN MODERN NOVELS, AND BIOGRAPHY IS POPULAR, BUT THERE IS
LITTLE DEMAND FOR SUCH SUBJECTS AS HISTORY, TRAVEL AND RELIGION. DESCRIBES THE
MOON READER, THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE AND THE PRODUCTION OF MOON BOOKS. MORE
WORKS IN MOON ARE NEEDED, BECAUSE AT PRESENT, IF READERS WANT A REAL CHOICE IN
BOOKS THEY HAVE TO READ BRAILLE. ASKS FOR COMMENTS FROM MOON READERS ON THE
ADEQUACY OF THE MOON LITERATURE EXTANT, AND ON THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD BE PUBLISHED.
