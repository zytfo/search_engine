THE FACTFINDER INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
FACTFINDER IS A MINICOMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION HANDLING PACKAGE DEVELOPED ON
THE BASIS OF TOTAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. WITHIN THE SYSTEM THE CONCEPTS OF
TEXT PROCESSING AND WORD PROCESSING ARE UNITED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT
OF INFORMATION AT EVERY STAGE. THUS, FACTFINDER COMBINES FLEXIBLE DATA INPUT
FACILITIES WITH A POWERFUL RETRIEVAL CAPABILITY, ENHANCED BY THE INCLUSION OF
EFFICIENT EDITING AND REPORTING FUNCTIONS. FACTFINDER IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED
FOR INTERACTIVE USE IN A MULTI-USER ENVIRONMENT. INPUT IS USER-DEFINED AND MAY
BE FREE TEXT OR FORMATTED. EDITING AND RETRIEVAL ARE ALSO ON-LINE PROCEDURES
AND DUE TO FACTFINDER'S EFFICIENT BACKGROUND PROCESSING FACILITY, THE UPDATING
AND PRINTING FUNCTIONS MAY RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THESE ON-LINE TERMINAL
ACTIVITIES. ANY BATCH ROUTINES ARE ALSO INITIATED AT THE TERMINALS ALTHOUGH
THESE ARE FEW AND OF A UTILITY OR SECURITY NATURE. FACTFINDER IS BASED ON THE
SWEDISH IMDOC SYSTEM AND IS M ARKETED BY MCS MINI-COMPUTER SYSTEMS LTD. THE
SOFTWARE IS WRITTEN IN EXTENSIVE BASIC AND THE SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE AS A
COMPLETE PACKAGE OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE BASED ON THE DATA GENERAL RANGE OF
MINICOMPUTERS. BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY MINI-COMPUTER
SYSTEMS LTD.
