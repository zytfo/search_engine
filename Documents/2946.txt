FUZZY REQUESTS' AN APPROACH TO WEIGHTED BOOLEAN SEARCHES.
     
CONCERNS THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO PERMIT A PATRON TO REPRESENT THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS INDEX TERMS IN A BOOLEAN REQUEST WHILE RETAINING THE
DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF A BOOLEAN SYSTEM. CLASSICAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS ARE
REVIEWED AND RELATED TO THE NOTION OF FUZZY SETS. THE FUZZY SET CONCEPT THEN
FORMS THE BASIS OF THE CONCEPT OF A FUZZY REQUEST IN WHICH WEIGHTS ARE
ASSIGNED TO INDEX TERMS. THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED, AND IT
IS SHOWN THAT SUCH SYSTEMS RETAIN THE MANIPULABILITY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN
REQUESTS.
