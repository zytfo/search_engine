TECHNOLOGY AND THE INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL: WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?.
     
EXAMINES THE LIKELY IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS, AND ON DATA BASE PRODUCERS, OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. DATA BASE
PRODUCERS WILL INCREASINGLY RELY ON HOME-BASED ABSTRACTORS WHO RECEIVE, CREATE
AND SEND ALL THEIR MATERIAL BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH
PROCEDURES FOR THE DATA BASE PRODUCERS ARE OUTLINED. INCREASING USE OF
VIDEODISCS FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IS ENVISAGED. THE IMPACT OF
NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IS THEN EXAMINED. USE
OF VIDEODISCS WILL MEAN A DECLINE IN THE USE OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
USE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS WILL LEAD TO GREATER USE OF THESE SYSTEMS BY
END-USERS. THE INTELLIGENT TERMINALS COULD BE USED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE
LANGUAGES, TO REFINE SEARCH STRATEGIES, TO STORE AND EDIT OUTPUT FROM SEARCHES
AND TO ADVISE USERS ON THE BEST DATA BASES AND BEST SEARCH STRATEGY TO USE.
ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THOSE LEADING TO THE 'OFFICE OF
THE FUTURE'. CONCLUDES THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC SHAKEOUT IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT THAT INFORMATION SCIENTISTS FACE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO
DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS BY THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT SCHOOLS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE TEACH THEIR STUDENTS TYPING
SKILLS. FINALLY, SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE ADVISABILITY OF OFFERING SOPHISTICATED
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE MADE.
