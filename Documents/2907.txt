ON-LINE, NEW AID IN REFERENCE WORK.
     
REPORTS ON AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ORGANISED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
AND HELD IN SEPT. 81. A NUMBER OF BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE DURING THE
LAST 3 YEARS CARRIED OUT EXPERIMENTS WITH THE USE OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS. RESULTS
OF THESE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S REPORT SERIES AND WERE
DISCUSSED AT THE CONFERENCE. THE QUESTION OF PAYMENT FOR ON-LINE SEARCHES WAS
DEBATED. THE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WAS OUTLINED, INCLUDING THE ONE
FROM GENTOFTE, DENMARK. IN LUTON CENTRAL LIBRARY, ENGLAND, WHICH FORMERLY
SUBSCRIBED TO ONLY A FEW CONVENTIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, INSTALLATION OF
ON-LINE FACILITIES HAS LED TO A LARGE EXPANSION. NEW USERS HAVE BEEN
ATTRACTED, THE LIBRARY'S IMAGE IMPROVED, AND THE ENSUING GOOD-WILL HAS BEEN A
USEFUL TOOL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CUTS. THE STAFF HAVE BECOME MORE COST
CONSCIOUS AND HENCE MORE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH USERS, WHO HAVE BEEN MORE
THOROUGHLY INTERVIEWED. MORE TIME IS NOW SPENT PREPARING THE SEARCH STRATEGY.
THE DANGER OF REDUNDANCIES AS A RESULT OF GREATER EFFICIENCY WAS THEREFORE
DISMISSED.
