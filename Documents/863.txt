MODULAR INDEXING IN A RELATIONALLY BASED DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

WHEN BASED ON A SINGLE MODEL, A DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM MAY BE COHERENTLY
DESIGNED, CONVENIENT TO USE, AND EASY TO MAINTAIN. THE RELATIONAL MODEL
PROVIDES A NATURAL WAY OF VIEWING DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL AND HAS A SOUND
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION. A PARTICULAR AREA OF INTEREST IS INDEXING. ALL
INDEXINGTOOLS (INCLUDING NEGATIVE DICTIONARIES, STEM DICTIONARIES, AND
THESAURI) ARE STORED AS RELATIONS AND ARE MANIPULATED USING RELATIONAL
OPERATIONS. THIS PROCEDURE MEANS THAT, CONCEPTUALLY, ALL INDEXING IS DONE AT
SEARCH TIME IN A MODULAR AND DYNAMIC FASHION. DESCRIBES THIS MODULAR APPROACH,
GIVES EXAMPLES, AND SUMMARISES THE ADVANTAGES.
