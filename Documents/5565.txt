REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. PROTESTANT PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA ARE RUN BY
THE BAVARIAN BRANCH OF THE GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICAL LIBRARIES WHICH
PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN RETURN FOR SOME
FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THE LIBRARIES, OPEN TO ALL, HAVE STOCKS COMPARABLE WITH
SMALL BRANCH LIBRARIES; THEY ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN UNDERPRIVILEGED
RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY ACT AS CENTRES FOR COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE. STAFF ARE
MAINLY VOLUNTARY WORKERS FOR WHOM PART-TIME TRAINING COURSES ARE ARRANGED. THE
ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES A QUARTERLY INFORMATION SHEET FOR BAVARIA AND A
QUARTERLY PERIODICAL COVERING THE WHOLE OF GERMANY. THE BAVARIAN BRANCH
