THE RESULTS OF A CATALOGUING IN PUBLICATION EXPERIMENT.
     
ON 1 SEPT 80, THE ROYAL LIBRARY OF THE NETHERLANDS AND THE ISBN BUREAU OF THE
DUTCH CENTRAL BOOKHOUSE BEGAN A 6-MONTH STUDY OF CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION. A
CIP OFFICE WAS CREATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY, TO WHICH 19 PUBLISHERS AGREED TO
SUBMIT DETAILS OF NEW BOOKS IN PREPARATION. FROM INFORMATION SUPPLIED
CATALOGUE ENTRIES WERE PREPARED AND FORWARDED TO THE PUBLISHERS FOR INCLUSION
IN THE APPROPRIATE BOOKS. AT THE END OF THE STUDY A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS
CIRCULATED TO THE PUBLISHERS WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE SCHEME, TOGETHER WITH
21 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND 26 BOOKSELLERS IN THE NETHERLANDS. ALMOST ALL
CONCERNED FELT THAT THE EXPERIMENT HAD BEEN A SUCCESS. HOWEVER, THE EXPERIENCE
OF CIP BUREAU STAFF SHOWED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT
BETWEEN PUBLISHERS AND THE BUREAU.
