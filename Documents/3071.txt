CULTURE FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE.
     
REPORT ON A VISIT TO CUBA TO STUDY THE CULTURAL CENTRES. A NATIONAL NETWORK OF
SUCH CENTRES IS BEING BUILT BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE'S DEPARTMENT FOR MASS
CULTURE. ACTIVITIES SERVE EDUCATIONAL, RECREATIVE AND IDEOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS.
EACH CENTRE HAS A DIRECTORATE, TECHNICAL COMMITTEE, CONTACT GROUP AND USER
GROUP, AND ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM CREATIVE WORKSHOPS, STUDY GROUPS, LECTURES,
MUSIC FESTIVALS, EXHIBITIONS, AND LIBRARY. THE ACTIVITIES LAID ON IN 1 OF
HAVANA'S CULTURAL CENTRES, THE PLAZA DE LA REVOLUCION, ARE DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL. THE CENTRE'S LIBRARY HAS MAINLY SPECIALISED WORKS NEEDED FOR THE
ACTIVITIES, ALTHOUGH THE CHILDREN'S SECTION HAS A SOMEWHAT BROADER SELECTION.
THE INTENTION IS THAT ALL CUBA'S DISTRICTS SHALL HAVE AS A MINIMUM A CULTURAL
CENTRE, HISTORICAL MUSEUM, PUBLIC LIBRARY, CINEMA, BOOKSHOP, ART SHOP, CHOIR,
ORCHESTRA, THEATRE AND ART GALLERY.
