SOME COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIANSHIP.

SINCE WORLD WAR II THERE HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE NETHERLANDS
IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE, SOCIAL WELFARE
AND EDUCATION. THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED IN AN ORDERLY MANNER BUT HAS
COME ABOUT BY THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF SEPARATE SECTORS. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES HAS BECOME A SUBJECT FOR MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE
DUTCH PARLIAMENT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE PROVISION FOR
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES.
IN FUTURE FACTORS WHICH WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES INCLUDE
THE SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE REDUCED
BIRTH-RATE. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES A REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS
NECESSARY.
