DATA-TAGGING EXPERIMENT FOR ENERGY-RELATED DOCUMENTS AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS
SERVICE.
     
AN EXPERIMENT IS DESCRIBED THAT EVALUATED THE USEFULNESS AND ECONOMIC
FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING DATA TAGS INTO SECONDARY INFORMATION FILES. TAGS
ARE BRIEF CODES THAT INDICATE THE PRESENCE IN A PRIMARY DOCUMENT OF SPECIFIC
TYPES OF NUMERICAL DATA. TAGS WERE SELECTED IN COOPERATION WITH USERS OF THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S (DOE) RECON SYSTEM AND ADDED TO A SPECIAL VERSION
OF THE COMPUTER-READABLE ENERGY FILE. RECON USERS ASSISTED IN AN EVALUATION OF
THE TAGGING PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT DATA TAGS DO INCREASE ACCESS TO
NUMERICAL DATA IN THE PRIMARY LITERATURE, BUT A FILE SPANNING SEVERAL YEARS IS
NECESSARY TO PRODUCE USEFUL RESULTS. EVALUATION OF PROCESSING COSTS REVEALED
THAT AFTER THE INITIAL TRAINING PERIOD, COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER
FOR THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF DATA TAGS EMPLOYED IN THIS STUDY. THE FEASIBILITY
OF INCLUDING DATA TAGS IN NONENERGY SECTIONS OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1WAS
EXAMIN ED WITH PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC AND EDITORIAL FACTORS. IT WAS
SHOWN THAT SUBJECT CONTENT GOVERNS THE SELECTION OF DATA TYPES TO BE TAGGED
FOR A SECTION OR GROUP OF RELATED SECTIONS WITH THE OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION
OF USER REQUIREMENTS.
