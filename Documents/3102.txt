WORKPLACE LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY' MUTUAL COMPETITION FOR THE BEST LOAN
STATISTICS.
     
AFTER THE 2ND WORLD WAR, WEST GERMANY CONTINUED AS IT LEFT OFF IN 1933, WITH
FACTORY LIBRARIES IN THE OLD PATRIARCHAL FORM AND LIBRARY POLICIES WITH
TRADITIONAL BOURGEOIS IDEALS. IN EAST GERMANY, HOWEVER, A PERIOD OF
DENAZIFICATION AND REBUILDING OF SOCIETY IN A SOCIALIST FORM FOLLOWED THE WAR.
LIBRARIES RECEIVED HIGH PRIORITY IN THE ANTI-FASCIST PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN, WITH
ACCESS TO LIBRARIES IN 96% OF DISTRICTS IN 1957 COMPARED TO 40% IN 1947. A
PURGE OF LIBRARY BOOKS WAS CARRIED OUT ON STALINIST PRINCIPLES WITH SOME
LIBRARIES LOSING UP TO 90% OF THEIR STOCK. HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
EXPANDED RAPIDLY, BUT WITHOUT DEVIATION FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE IN BOOK
SELECTION. A NETWORK OF WORKPLACE LIBRARIES UNDER THE TRADE UNIONS HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED IN KEEPING WITH THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO LIBRARIES FOR
IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION. THE BASIS FOR THESE LIBRARIES IS THE MAXIM' ALL WORKERS
MUST READ. TH E LIBRARIES MUST REACH A CERTAIN NORM IN LENDING FIGURES AND
CONTROL WITH THE MATERIAL BORROWED IS POSSIBLE. THE WORKPLACE LIBRARIES, FAR
FROM BEING AN EXPRESSION OF WORKING CLASS DEMOCRACY, ARE AN IDEOLOGICAL
INSTRUMENT OF THE TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP DIRECTED AT THE WORKING CLASS.
