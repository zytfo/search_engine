THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE).

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DICK REUMER, DIRECTOR OF THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM, ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE.
REUMER BELIEVES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FACING LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS IN 1982 ARE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO REDUCE SUBSIDIES TO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES BY 15% AND THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE PUBLIC
SERVICES, WHICH WILL REPLACE THE PRESENT PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT. FOR THE NBLC THE
NEW LEGISLATION WILL MEAN THE DECENTRALISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES THROUGHOUT
THE REGIONS AND CLOSER COOPERATION AMONGST LIBRARIES IN THE SAME AREA. TO
CELEBRATE THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NBLC A JUBILEE CONGRESS IS TO BE HELD AT
WHICH THE CENTRE'S SERVICES WILL COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AND WILL BE MORE
ACTIVELY PROMOTED TO THE PUBLIC.
