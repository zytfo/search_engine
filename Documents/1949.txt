THE IMPACT OF MICROCOMPUTERS ON DATA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS.
     
CRITICALLY EXAMINES, FROM SEVERAL POINTS OF VIEW, THE IMPACT OF THE
MICROPROCESSOR ON DATA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS; ANALYSES THE USE OF
MICROCOMPUTERS IN THE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS OF SUCH NETWORKS; REVIEWS SPECIFIC
AREAS WHERE MICROCOMPUTERS HAVE, CAN OR SHOULD TAKE OVER AND EXPAND FUNCTIONS
PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED BY RANDOM LOGIC; INDICATES FUTURE TRENDS IN
MICROPROCESSOR APPLICATIONS TO DATA COMMUNICATION; AND ANALYSES THE
CONFLICTING INFLUENCES ON THE RATE OF UTILISATION OF MICROPROCESSORS.
