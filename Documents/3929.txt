PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS AND GATEWAY LINK TO PUBLIC SERVICES.
     
PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS FOR CORPORATE IN-HOUSE USE, AND FOR CLOSED USER
GROUPS, ARE ATTRACTING INCREASING ATTENTION. AT THE SAME TIME, ADVANCES ARE
OCCURRING IN THE FIELD OF PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE VIDEOTEX NETWORK DESIGN, WHERE
THE TREND IS TOWARDS CONNECTING INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL COMPUTERS INTO PUBLIC
PACKET NETWORKS FOR ACCESS BY VIDEOTEX SUBSCRIBERS THROUGH GATEWAY LINKS IN
THE NETWORK. IN THE FUTURE, THERE WILL BE A CONVERGENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE
VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS FOR CORPORATE USE, AND EXTERNAL COMPUTERS CONNECTED TO PUBLIC
VIDEOTEX NETWORKS.
