WHERE THERE IS NO VISION THE PEOPLE PERISH.
     
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., 17 JUNE 80. FORCES ARE ALREADY IN MOTION THAT
WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANSHIP. IN ADDITION TO
CHANGES IN ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTRES, CHANGES IN THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY, THE
MODE OF DELIVERING INFORMATION BY LIBRARIANS, USE OF COMPUTERS IN INFORMATION
MANIPULATION AND RETRIEVAL, USERS' ACCESS TO INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY ARE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. PROPOSES THAT HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANS CAN
PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING THEIR PROFESSIONAL FUTURE
BY BEING INFORMED, EXPANDING COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, PLANNING, CEASING TO HOLD A
ROMANTIC VIEW OF THE PROFESSION, AND BECOMING ACHIEVERS RATHER THAN
SUSTAINERS.
