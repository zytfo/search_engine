COLLECTING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DATA ON THE PRODUCTION OF AUDIO, VISUAL
AND MICROFORM MATERIALS.
     
THIS PAPER REVIEWS UNESCO ACTIVITIES FOR THE COLLECTION OF NATIONAL PRODUCTION
DATA OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS AND MICROFORMS AND PRESENTS POSSIBLE APPROACHES
TO THE TASK. UNESCO HAS FOR SOME YEARS COLLECTED DATA ON THE PRODUCTION OF
PRINTED MATERIALS, BUT WHILE RECOGNISING THE NEED FOR COLLECTING SIMILAR
STATISTICS ON NONPRINT MEDIA, IT HAS NOT YET DONE SO. IF UNESCO WERE TO
UNDERTAKE THE TASK, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ENLIST THE AID OF INTERNATIONAL
ASSOCIATIONS AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF PRODUCERS OF THESE MATERIALS.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
