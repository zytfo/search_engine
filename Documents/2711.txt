THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROMOTER OF TECHNO-FASCISM' THE (ANTI-)SOCIAL
CONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION.
     
MODERN SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, INSUFFICIENT
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION. THE
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE UNDERTAKEN
NO STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THEIR MEMBERS' BEHALF APART FROM THE
NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE), WHICH IN 1979 FORMED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WAYS OF
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE MISUSE OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
COMMITTEE WERE REJECTED IN 1980 BY NBLC MEMBERS AS TOO RADICAL. AUTOMATION
WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS IN LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS AND
LIBRARIANS MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION.
