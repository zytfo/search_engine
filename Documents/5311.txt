THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS' THE LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
DEALING WITH THEFT FROM THE COLLECTIONS AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.

EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IS WRITTEN OFF BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES
AS A RESULT OF THEFT OR DAMAGE BY LIBRARY USERS. IN THE MAASTRICHT PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS A STUDY OF THE PROBLEM MADE FROM JAN-JUNE 81 SHOWED
THAT SOME MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE LIBRARY WITHOUT REGISTERING THE
TRANSACTION, SOME WAS BORROWED ON TICKETS CONTAINING FALSE OR INCORRECT
INFORMATION, WHILE OTHERS WERE BORROWED AND NOT RETURNED, OR RETURNED IN A
DAMAGED CONDITION. WHERE PROOF OF THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY PROPERTY
EXISTS THE DUTCH CIVIL CODE ALLOWS LIBRARY AUTHORITIES TO INSTRUCT THE LOCAL
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF JUSTICE TO TAKE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GUILTY PARTY.
WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THE JUDGE MAY ORDER COMPENSATION TO BE
MADE TO THE LIBRARY CONCERNED.
