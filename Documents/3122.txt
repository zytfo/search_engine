ARCHIVAL RESOURCES AND HISTORY' SOME IDEAS ON A SYSTEMS-PROSPECTUS APPROACH.
     
DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND ARCHIVAL
OPERATIONS, WHERE THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE 2 CONSTITUTES A SYSTEM RESULTING
IN THE PRODUCTION OF HISTORY. TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE
ARCHIVE FROM THE 19TH CENTURY ONWARDS, WITH REFERENCE TO THE EVOLUTION OF A
CONCEPT OF HISTORY BASED NOT ON THEMATIC OR QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES, BUT
SEEKING TO GENERATE NEW OBJECTS OF STUDY. THE CRUCIAL NECESSITY FOR FULL
COOPERATION BETWEEN ARCHIVISTS AND RESEARCHERS IS ILLUSTRATED, AND SHOWN TO BE
ESSENTIAL FOR A PROSPECTUS READING OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST, UNENCUMBERED
BY TRANSITORY CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDES.
