INFORMATION THEORY AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION.

INFORMAL AND FORMAL COMMUNICATION PROCESSES ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE PRIMARY
JOURNAL LITERATURE. BOTH PROCESSES IMPOSE STRUCTURES ON THE AUTHORS WHO
PUBLISH THEIR RESEARCH, AND THE FORMAL PROCESS IMPOSES A STRUCTURE ON THE
JOURNALS WHICH PUBLISH SCIENTIFIC PAPERS. IT IS SHOWN THAT INFORMATION THEORY
CAN BE APPLIED TO THESE STRUCTURES TO EVALUATE AUTHOR AND JOURNAL
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNICATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS IDENTIFY THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE AUTHORS AND JOURNALS IN AN AREA OF
ACTIVE RESEARCH.
