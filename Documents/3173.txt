SOME THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCING OF LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT SAVING MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY CUTTING ITS LIBRARY BUDGET IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS APPLIED TO SUCH AREAS AS STAFF CUTS AND
PROCESSING BACKLOGS, SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEADING TO UNDERMINING OF
THE LIBRARY'S SUPPORTIVE ROLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S TEACHING AND RESEARCH
FUNCTION. ARGUES THAT RATIONALISATION OF SUBJECT INTERESTS AND SUBJECTS TAUGHT
BY THE UNIVERSITIES IN AN AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
