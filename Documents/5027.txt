ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL PLAN (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK OF THE RNSKHBINFORM OF THE
KIRGIZ SSR).

THE PROVISION OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICES IN KIRGIZIA HAS GREATLY
IMPROVED WITH THE FOUNDATION, IN 1975, OF THE RESPUBLIKANSKAYA NAUCHNAYA
SELSKOKHOZYAISTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA (AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY OF THE REPUBLIC), ITS
DESIGNATION AS THE CENTRE OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRALISED NETWORK OF AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES. THESE
FACTORS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROVISION OF CENTRALLY PLANNED, ORGANISED
AND COORDINATED BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION COMPRISING' REFERENCE INFORMATION
SERVICES, PROVISION OF CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION TO AGRICULTURAL
SPECIALISTS, ANSWERING OF INDIVIDUAL ENQUIRIES, COMPILATION OF CURRENT AND
RETROSPECTIVE SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND THE PROMOTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
MATERIALS. THE USE OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY'S STOCK BY SPECIALISTS IN REMOTE
RURAL AREAS IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH AN INTERLIBRARY LENDING SERVICE RUN BY
THE NET WORK.
