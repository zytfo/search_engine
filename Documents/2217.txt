INFORMATION AND REFERRAL DATA: INFORMATION AND FEEDBACK FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.
     
A BOUNDARY HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A DEMARCATION LINE SEPARATING AN ORGANISATION
FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDING ACCESS FOR THE TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO
AND FROM THE ORGANISATION. USING A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL
EXPLORATORY SURVEY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: DO I&R SERVICES, OCCUPANTS OF
BOUNDARY POSITIONS VIS-A-VIS SOCIAL ORGANISATIONS, SERVE AS SOURCES OF
INFORMATION INPUTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT FOR COUNTRY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES?
FINDINGS SHOW THAT I&R DATA ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION FROM THE
ENVIRONMENT FOR MOST OF THE AGENCIES SURVEYED, DEPENDENT NOT ONLY ON
ORGANISATIONAL SUPPORTS BUT ALSO ON FEEDBACK PROCESSES THAT ENCOURAGE
INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. SUCH
DEVELOPMENTS MUST BE GUIDED BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS SUCH
DATA CAN ANSWER AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA.
