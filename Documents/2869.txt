ALTERNATIVES FOR FUTURE LIBRARY CATALOGS' A COST MODEL' FINAL REPORT OF THE
LIBRARY CATALOG COST MODEL PROJECT PREPARED FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH
LIBRARIES.
     
UNDER ARL SPONSORSHIP, KING RESEARCH, INC., DEVELOPED A LIBRARY CATALOG COST
MODEL TO ASSIST 72 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES IN COMPARING THE COST OF
ALTERNATIVE FUTURE FORMS OF CATALOGUE, EMPHASISING THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING
AACR2. 68 LIBRARIES PREPARED INPUTS CHARACTERISING THEIR COSTS AND MODES OF
OPERATION, AND THESE WERE USED, WITH THE MODEL, TO COMPUTE COSTS OF
ALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE FORMS. INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THE MODEL WERE HIGHLY
VARIABLE. COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING AACR2 WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 4-7% OF THE TOTAL
COST OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A CATALOGUE. THE MODEL CAN BE A USEFUL
PLANNING, BUDGETING AND STAFFING TOOL, AND MAY BE SEEN AS A PROTOTYPE,
ADAPTABLE TO PROJECT COSTS OF OTHER LIBRARY OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY
ACQUISITIONS. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR FUTURE MODEL DEVELOPMENT.
