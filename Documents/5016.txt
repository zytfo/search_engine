DOCUMENTATION.

DURING FEB 81 STAFF OF THE P.A. TIELE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE HAGUE,
NETHERLANDS DISCUSSED THE USE OF 2BIBLIOTHEEK EN DOCUMENTATIE' HANDBOEK TEN
DIENSTE VAN DE OPLEIDINGEN1 (2LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION' A HANDBOOK FOR
STUDENTS1) 2ND EDITION, 1979 AS A TEACHING INSTRUMENT. THE HANDBOOK IS USED AT
THE SCHOOL AS A BASIC INTRODUCTION FOR STUDENTS TO A NUMBER OF COURSE
SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF A NUMBER OF TOPICS AND THE USE OF
SPECIALISED TERMINOLOGY MAKE THE WORK UNSUITABLE FOR USE AS A STUDENT
TEXTBOOK. IN ADDITION, THE TEXT OF THE BOOK, WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY SEVERAL
AUTHORS, SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF BALANCE AND IS FURTHER MARRED BY AN INADEQUATE
INDEX.
