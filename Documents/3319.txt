BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.
     
REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON THE USE OF BATCH AND ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
BASES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS
OF A SURVEY OF US SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND MEDIUM SIZED RESEARCH LIBRARIES
DESIGNED TO ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES IN SELECTION
AND COLLECTION EVALUATION. CONCLUDES THAT ON-LINE DATA BASES ARE BEING
PRIMARILY USED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION AS PART OF THE SELECTION
PROCESS, AND THAT VERY LITTLE USE IN COLLECTION EVALUATION WAS REPORTED,
ALTHOUGH ITS POTENTIAL WAS ACKNOWLEDGED. DESCRIBES A RECENT EVALUATION OF
CHEMISTRY HOLDINGS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT
ALBANY.
