ON-LINE SEARCH EXPERIENCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TEXTURE OF ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE METALLGESELLSCHAFT AG (METAL
ASSOCIATION COMPANY), FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN, NOTED THAT MANY ON-LINE SEARCHERS
REQUIRED INFORMATION FROM 2 OR MORE DATA BASES SINCE THE INFORMATION OVERLAP
BETWEEN DIFFERENT BASES IS NARROW. AN INVESTIGATION WAS MADE CONCERNING SEARCH
TERM FREQUENCIES IN MATERIAL ON ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS AND CONCERNING THE
INFORMATION POTENTIAL OF VARIOUS DATA BASES BETWEEN 1972-78 AND 1964-71;
RESULTS ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF DATA PROCESSING MUST BE
WATCHED; MORE SIMPLIFICATION, UNITY AND ACCURACY ARE NEEDED. THE MANY NATIONAL
DATA STORES ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE AMALGAMATED INTO 1
WELL-ORGANISED DATA BANK, SINCE MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE
MULTIDISCIPLINARY.
