DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE IN STORE-AND-FORWARD NETWORKS.
     
STORE-AND-FORWARD NETWORK DEADLOCKS MAY BE AVOIDED BY FORWARDING MESSAGES FROM
BUFFER TO BUFFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH A LOOP-FREE DIRECTED BUFFER GRAPH WHICH
ACCOMMODATES ALL THE DESIRED MESSAGE ROUTES. USE OF GUARANTEED PATHS IN THE
BUFFER GRAPH AND OPTIONAL PATH SWITCHING ARE DESCRIBED, ALONG WITH MESSAGE
RECLASSIFICATION TO FREE MEMBERS OF THE COMMON BUFFER POOL. AN EFFICIENT
BUFFER-COUNTING PROCEDURE IN EACH NODE HANDLES MESSAGES REQUIRING SEVERAL
BUFFERS, INCREASES FLEXIBILITY OF BUFFER USAGE, MINIMISES OVERHEADS DURING
MESSAGE RECLASSIFICATION OR PATH SWITCHING, AND SIMPLIFIES JUMPING BETWEEN
NORMAL LOW-OVERHEAD OPERATION WHEN DEADLOCK IS FAR AND MORE CAREFUL OPERATION
WHEN DEADLOCK IS NEAR.
