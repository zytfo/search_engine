FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE ROYAL
LIBRARY REFLECT THE LIBRARY'S 2 MAIN FUNCTIONS, THAT OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL
LIBRARY AND STOCKHOLM'S CENTRAL LIBRARY IN THE FIELDS OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL
SCIENCES. MATERIAL ACQUIRED IN KEEPING WITH THE 1ST FUNCTION (SUECANA
EXTRANEA) IS DIVIDED INTO 4 SECTIONS-FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS OF SWEDISH WRITERS'
WORKS, WORKS IN SWEDISH PUBLISHED ABROAD, WORKS ON SWEDEN AND WORKS OF SWEDISH
NATIONALS PUBLISHED ABROAD. EXCHANGES OF PUBLICATIONS WITH LIBRARIES IN OTHER
COUNTRIES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACQUISITIONS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO
THE LIBRARY'S 2ND FUNCTION.
