A SOMEWHAT UNBUREAUCRATIC PROJECT.
     
DESCRIBES THE BACKGROUND TO A CAMPAIGN TO REACH MORE READERS WITH QUALITY
LITERATURE INITIATED BY THE CULTURAL COUNCIL. IN A MEMORANDUM OF FEB 81 IT WAS
DECIDED THAT THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD CONSIST OF 2 PROJECTS' A REGIONAL PROJECT, IN
WHICH NEW METHODS SHOULD BE USED TO STIMULATE INTEREST IN READING AND IMPROVE
THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE METHODS EVALUATED; AND A
NATIONAL INFORMATION CAMPAIGN WITH THE OBJECT OF GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT
BOOKS, AND STIMULATE INTEREST IN THE REGIONAL PROJECT. CONTACT WITH VARIOUS
ORGANISATIONS WAS MADE, ABOVE ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION. IN THE
REGIONAL PROJECT THE EMPHASIS WAS TO BE ON LOCAL INVOLVEMENT. THE PROJECT,
CALLED THE DALA PROJECT, IS TO START IN THE AUTUMN 81 IN THE KOPPARBERG REGION
AND HAS 4 CORNERSTONES' SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STUDY CIRCLES AND MASS
MEDIA. THE PROJECT SHOULD LEAD TO COOPERATION AND BETTER USE OF RESOURCES, BUT
ALSO TO SUGGESTIONS FOR MODELS FOR FUTURE LOCAL LIBRARY  SERVICES AND FOR THE
OPINION FORMING ROLE OF THE CULTURAL COUNCIL.
