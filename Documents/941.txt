VISUAL DISPLAY UNITS (VDUS) HAVE ALTERED VERY LITTLE FOR SOME YEARS BUT USE IN
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WUCH AS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND PRESTEL IS MAKING CHANGE
INCREASINGLY LIKELY. NEW TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIONS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AND
INCLUDE GREATER INTELLIGENCE, GRAPHICS AND COLOUR FACILITIES. DESCRIPTIONS OF
SOME DEVELOPMENTS AT PRESENT CONFINED TO RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS ARE PROVIDED.
AMONG THESE IS THE TEXT TERMINAL, FROM QUEEN MARY COLLEGE, WHICH ALLOWS THE
USER TO CREATE PIECES OF PAPER AND MOVE THEM AROUND ON THE SCREEN AS THOUGH ON
A DESK TOP.
