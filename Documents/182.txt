THE COMPUTERISED LIBRARY AS A WORKING MILIEU.

NO DANISH LIBRARY IS YET FULLY COMPUTERISED, THOUGH INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE IN
OPERATION. SPECIALISED EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN-SERVICE COURSES, IS NECESSARY,
BUT LIBRARIANS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPUTERISATION MAY STEM FROM SEVERAL
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED. STAFF MAY FEEL
RULED BY THE MACHINE UNLESS ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM THOROUGHLY AND
TAKE PART IN ORGANISING WORK PROCESSES. IN SETTING UP SAMKAT AT THE DANISH
NATIONAL LIBRARY, CATALOGUERS HAVE BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THE 1ST
(CATALOGUING) STAGE, AND WILL TAKE PART IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM TO
ENSURE CONSISTENCY. WHEN STAFF FEEL AT EASE WITH THE COMPUTER, ITS ADVANTAGES
INCLUDE MAKING THEIR WORK LESS STRENUOUS BUT MORE STIMULATING (PROVIDED
GOOD-QUALITY PRINT-OUTS ARE ATTAINED) AND IMPROVING INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND SERVICE TO READERS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WORKING
CONDITIONS, AND INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPME NTS AT A SUITABLE TEMPO.
