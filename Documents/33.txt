TRAINING LIBRARIANS FOR THE 80S.

TEXT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND, AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, N. IRELAND BRANCH, HELD
IN BLARNEY, COUNTY CORK IN MAY 80. EXAMINES SOME LIKELY AREAS OF CONCERN OF
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE 1980S, INCLUDING: THE NEED FOR
MORE TRAINING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY; THE INCREASING
IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION SKILLS, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED ARTS OF BOOK SELECTION. ARGUES THAT
THE PRESENT UK ONE YEAR POST GRADUATE COURSE FOR LIBRARIANS IS NOT LONG
ENOUGH, AND STRESSES THE NEED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION WITHIN THE PROFESSION.
