NEW TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDIES.
     
THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE FACULTY OF
PHILOSOPHY WITHIN THE COMENIUS UNIVERSITY IN BRATISLAVA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE
FOR 30 YEARS. AT PRESENT, BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME UNDERGRADUATE AND
POSTGRADUATE COURSES ARE OFFERED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW IDEAS IN THE
CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CURRICULA HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUBJECTED
TO PROFOUND AND SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. THE DURATION OF UNDERGRADUATE
COURSES HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 5 TO 4 YEARS. IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON
LIBRARIANSHIP AND/OR INFORMATION SCIENCE AS WELL AS ON CLOSELY RELATED
SUBJECTS. THE AIM OF EQUIPPING STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD
OF THEIR PROSPECTIVE TYPE OF LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED. ALTHOUGH IT FELL
SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, THE EXTENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUILDING WILL
NEVERTHELESS ENABLE THE TEACHING AND OTHER STAFF TO BUILD UP RESOURCES OF
AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS,  AND ALSO TO INVOLVE THEIR
STUDENTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS.
