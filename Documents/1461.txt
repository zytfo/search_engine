THE POLISH TERRITORIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY SYSTEM' ORGANISATIONAL MATTERS.

DISCUSSES THE ORGANISATION OF A SYSTEM OF TERRITORIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES UNDER
FORMATION IN POLAND, BASED ON THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE 3RD ALL-COUNTRY MEETING
OF BIBLIOGRAPHERS, 1978. THE NEW SYSTEM IS BASED ON A PLANNED, CONTROLLED
SYSTEM OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERING THE WHOLE TERRITORY OF THE COUNTRY, AND
SYNCHRONISED WITH THE COUNTRY'S PRESENT ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION. IT IS
DESIGNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, BY RECORDING
INFORMATION SOURCES NOT AT PRESENT COVERED BY IT. TERRITORIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
ARE CONSIDERED AS INFORMATION TOOLS WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
SINTO (NATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION). COMPARES THE
SYSTEM WITH FOREIGN BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. THE SYSTEM IS ORGANISED JOINTLY BY
THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND ARTS AND THE POLISH LIBRARY SYSTEM.
