ENTRY OF LOCAL DATA ON OCLC' THE OPTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF
ARCHIVAL TAPES.
     
THE OCLC SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN ENTERING INSTITUTION
SPECIFIC DATA FOR AN ITEM. IN THE PAST, POLICIES FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA HAVE
BEEN FORMULATED IN MANY LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF CATALOGUE CARD APPEARANCE,
BUT THE INCREASING USE OF OCLC TAPE PRODUCTS REQUIRES REEXAMINATION OF MANY OF
THE LOCAL DATA PRACTICES NOW IN USE. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF
VARIATIONS FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA ON THE PART OF BCR OCLC LIBRARIES. THE
RESULTS ARE PRESENTED HERE, ALONG WITH A DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES
AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF OCLC TAPES.
