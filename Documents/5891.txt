ABN AND THE ART OF COST-EFFECTIVE CATALOGUING: THE CHALLENGE IN LIBRARY
AUTOMATION FOR THE EARLY EIGHTIES.

THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA HAS RECEIVED PERMISSION TO DEVELOP AN
AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK (ABN), BUT NO EXTRA RESOURCES HAVE BEEN
GRANTED FOR IT; THE SERVICE MAY THEREFORE NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE ALL ITS
POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS AS QUICKLY AS SOME WOULD LIKE. SUGGESTS THAT THROUGH
THE CREATION OF 'SERVICE CENTRE' NETWORKS, AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A MAJOR
SUPPORTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE BENEFITS OF THE ABN'S
EXISTENCE CAN BE BROUGHT TO A GREAT MANY LIBRARIES. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH ABN
MAY BE INTEGRATED INTO A NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH WILL COORDINATE THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY'S INITIATIVES AND THE 'BOTTOM-UP' DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY
TAKEN PLACE AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE.
