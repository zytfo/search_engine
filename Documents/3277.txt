CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE CHILDREN
ACCESS TO INFORMATION, WE MUST' ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCE-SHARING
ARRANGEMENTS; GRANT CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM; AND INCLUDE
CHILDREN'S MATERIALS AND RESOURCES IN THE DEVELOPING DATA SYSTEMS. CURRENT
STUDIES REVEAL THAT, ALTHOUGH AS CHILDREN REACH JUNIOR HIGH AGE THEY USE THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY PREDOMINANTLY FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS, NEITHER SCHOOL NOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE CHILD'S TOTAL PATTERN OF INFORMATION SEEKING.
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, TIME, AND SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS BASED ON LIBRARY
RESOURCES CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PATTERN. WHILE MULTIPLE COOPERATIVES SUCH AS
THOSE DEVELOPING IN COLORADO AND BEING INITIATED IN NEW YORK ARE OF INTEREST
AND SHOW PROMISE, LARGE-SCALE FAILURE TO DEVELOP INTER- AND INTRALIBRARY LOAN
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AS USERS
FURTHER INHIBIT ACCESS BY THE YOUNG. AS OF THIS TIME, LITTLE OF THE MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF CURRICULAR, HISTORICAL, TEXTUAL, OR LITERARY MATERIALS FOR CHILDREN
ARE BEING INCLUDED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED DATA BASES AND SYSTEMS, THUS
DENYING THEIR ACCESS TO ADULTS AS WELL AS TO YOUTH. IN FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF
ACCESS FOR THE YOUNG, LIBRARIANS MUST DEVELOP BROADER COMPETENCIES IN THE
AREAS OF MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY.
