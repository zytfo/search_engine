BOOKS FOR THE HANDICAPPED, FOR EXAMPLE IN A LIBRARY.
     
IN THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED, THIS LIBRARIAN ARRANGED AN AUTHOR'S
READING OF A BOOK ON HANDICAP AND BOOK DISPLAYS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND
TEENAGERS, COMPLEMENTED BY SELECTIVE BOOK INDEXES AND INFORMATION ON LOCAL
FACILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED. 2 INDEXES WERE PRODUCED, 1 DIRECTED AT
TEACHERS AND PARENTS, FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND ANOTHER FOR CHILDREN
FROM 10 YEARS UPWARDS. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH CORRECT SELECTION
CRITERIA SO AS TO PRESENT MATERIAL THAT WOULD HELP NORMAL CHILDREN TO OVERCOME
THEIR FEAR OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND TO COME NEARER TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR
PROBLEMS. MATERIAL SOURCES INCLUDED THE LIBRARY CATALOGUE AND INDEXES PRODUCED
BY THE DEUTSCHE LESEGESELLSCHAFT (GERMAN READERS' SOCIETY).
