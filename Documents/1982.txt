OUR OWN CHILDREN'S MAGAZINES: INSURING THEIR FUTURE.
     
IF CANADIAN CHILDREN'S MAGAZINES ARE TO REMAIN 'ALIVE', LIBRARIANS AND
ADMINISTRATORS MUST PROMOTE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN THE WAY
THEY RESPOND TO THEM. THE LIBRARY COMMUNITY RESPONDS FAVOURABLY TO CHILDREN'S
MAGAZINES, BUT ONLY A MINORITY OF THE COUNTRY'S SCHOOL CHILDREN HAS ACCESS TO
THEM IN THEIR SCHOOL LIBRARY.
