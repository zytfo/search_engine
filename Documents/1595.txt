THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION.
     
THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION DIFFERS FROM MOST PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN THAT
IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RANK-ORDER S OF THE ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR
PRODUCTIVITY (FROM HIGHEST DOWN TO LOWEST) RATHER THAN WITH THE NUMERICAL
VALUES N OF THE ELEMENT'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE DEFINING RELATIONSHIP IS THAT S IS
EXPONENTIALLY RELATED TO G, THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION OF THE ELEMENTS OF
RANK-ORDER S OR LESS. THIS IMPLIES A ZIPF-LIKE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEAN
PRODUCTIVITY AND RANK-ORDER, WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE WEBER-FECHNER LAW OF
PSYCHOPHYSICS. A VARIATIONAL SPECIFICATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS GIVEN, AND
IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
BRADFORD AND THAT OF THE USUAL DISTRIBUTIONS IS ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEBESGUE AND RIEMANN INTEGRATION.
