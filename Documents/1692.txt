THE URQUHART BUILDING OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION' THE DESIGN OF A
SINGLE FUNCTION LIBRARY BUILDING.
     
A STAGED BUILDING PROGRAMME HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MEET THE GROWTH IN DEMAND ON
THE BLLD AND TO HOUSE ITS INCREASED STOCK. THE URQUHART BUILDING, THE SITE'S
MAIN BUILDING, IS DESIGNED FOR EASY ACCESS TO HIGH-USE STOCK, FAST FLOW OF
MATERIAL, AND FUTURE FLEXIBILITY. THE GROUND FLOOR RECEIVES AND DESPATCHES
POST, AND MECHANICAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT MOVES REQUEST FORMS AND LIBRARY
MATERIALS TO THE PROCESSING AND RECORDS AREA ON THE 1ST FLOOR AND THE 6
FURTHER STOREYS THAT HOUSE STOCK. THERE ARE LARGE AREAS FOR ACCESS AND
MACHINERY ON THE STORAGE FLOORS. THE SHELVING FOR BOTH HARD-COPY AND
MICROFORMS WAS SPECIALLY DESIGNED. MECHANICAL HANDLING SYSTEMS INCLUDE
CONVEYORS IN THE PACKING AREAS, AUTOMATIC VERTICAL ELEVATORS, AND MOBILE
CONTAINERS TO CARRY REQUEST FORMS BETWEEN REQUEST PROCESSING AND STORAGE
AREAS. OTHER BUILDINGS ON THE SITE WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE STOCK EXPANSION.
