LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED IN FINLAND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. THE ORGANISATION OF HOSPITAL AND NURSING HOME
LIBRARIES IN FINLAND IS BASED ON THE 1961 LIBRARY ACT, THE RELEVANT PASSAGES
OF WHICH ARE PROBABLY DERIVED FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE MUNICIPALITIES
WHICH HAVE PROVIDED SUCH SERVICES SINCE THE 1940S. THE LIBRARIES ARE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND RECEIVE HIGHER GOVERNMENT
GRANTS THAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTION AND PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATE
CLOSELY IN THE LIBRARY'S DAY-TO-DAY RUNNING. OUTLINES THE ACTIVITIES IN SUCH
LIBRARIES, DEFICIENCIES, STAFF TRAINING, AND LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
NON-HOSPITALISED HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE WHOLE SUBJECT IS BEING INVESTIGATED
BY 2 WORKING GROUPS.
