ZIMBABWEAN BIBLIOGRAPHY' RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS.

PART 6 IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES SURVEYING RHODESIAN/ZIMBABWEAN BIBLIOGRAPHY.
EXAMINES 56 BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON A VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN LIFE
PUBLISHED SINCE THE 5TH ARTICLE IN THE SERIES WAS PUBLISHED IN OCT 77 (2SEE1
79/3136). MOST OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERED DEAL WITH HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY,
CONTEMPORARY AFFAIRS AND AFRICAN NATIONALISM BUT SCIENTIFIC, RELIGIOUS AND ART
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. IT APPEARS THAT INITIATIVE IN LOCAL
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CREATIVITY IS PASSING TO THE ACADEMIC AND SPECIALIST WHICH MAY
BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN TO THE LIBRARIAN WHO BELIEVES THAT BEST RESULTS ARE
OBTAINED WHEN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL EXPERTISE IS COMBINED WITH SUBJECT SPECIALIST
KNOWLEDGE.
