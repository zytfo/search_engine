REPORT.
     
IN 1979 THE COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES, INC., AWARDED A CONTRACT TO
BATTELLE-COLUMBUS LABORATORIES TO STUDY THE ECONOMIC AND SERVICE IMPACTS OF
LINKING THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES MAINTAINED BY THE US BIBLIOGRAPHIC
ORGANISATIONS. 3 LINK ALTERNATIVES FOR 3 POSSIBLE SERVICES WERE EVALUATED'
SHARED CATALOGUING OF CURRENT MONOGRAPHS, INTERLIBRARY LOAN, AND REFERENCE
SEARCHING. THE LINKS WERE TO BE BETWEEN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (LC), OHIO COLLEGE
LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC), WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK (WLN) AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES
INFORMATION NETWORK (RLIN). THE LINKS EXAMINED WERE DIRECT TAPE DELIVERY,
ON-LINE 'NATIVE' MODE VIA DEDICATED LINE AND ON-LINE 'TRANSLATION' MODE VIA
DEDICATED LINE. RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE DISCUSSED AND THE NEXT STEPS FOR
NETWORK PLANNERS ARE SUGGESTED.
