A MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
FEATURES OF A MICROPROCESSOR BASED ARCHITECTURE FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM ARE ILLUSTRATED. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING 3
FUNCTIONAL BLOCKS: THE 'QUERY PROCESSOR', THE 'SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTERS' AND THE
'ANSWER COMPOSER'. THE QUERY PROCESSOR PARSES THE QUERIES AND BREAKS THE
COMPLEX QUERY INTO SIMPLE QUERIES. EACH SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTER IS ABLE TO
PERFORM THE OPERATIONS SATISFYING A SIMPLE QUERY. FINALLY, THE ANSWER COMPOSER
PUTS TOGETHER THE RESULTS OF ALL SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTERS AND PRODUCES THE
RESPONSE TO THE QUERY ORIGINALLY RAISED.
