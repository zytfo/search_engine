TERMINOLOGY DOCUMENTATION IN GERMAN STANDARDS THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
TERMINOLOGY DATABANK.

THE GERMAN STANDARDS INSTITUTE HAS COLLECTED 30,000 STANDARD TERMINOLOGICAL
DEFINITIONS AND A FURTHER 30,000 SUBJECT TERMS NOT YET STANDARDISED, THROUGH
THE WORK OF OVER 100 COMMITTEES. THE ONLY WAY TO PRODUCE A CLEAR,
COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THEIR WORK WOULD BE BY CONSTRUCTING A TERMINOLOGY DATA
BANK WHICH MUST PROVIDE ACCESS POSSIBILITIES FOR TERMS AND SOURCES, REFERENCES
TO SYNONYMS, DISCARDED TERMS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE EQUIVALENTS, LINKS WITH THE
DINST ALTERATION SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN THE COMPILATION OF SUBJECT
DICTIONARIES AND A THESAURUS ON STANDARD DOCUMENTATION. A PILOT PROJECT ON
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION TERMINOLOGY HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL; A DATA BANK
COVERING ALL STANDARD TERMINOLOGY COULD BE PRODUCED IN 2-3 YEARS.
