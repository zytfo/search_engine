LIBRARY LITERACY: WHO? WHEN? WHERE?.

THE PROBLEM OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY EDUCATION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS
HAS FAR-REACHING RESULTS. ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS MUST TEACH STUDENTS THE BASICS
OF LIBRARY USE BEFORE EMBARKING ON COURSE-RELATED INSTRUCTION-ALL IN A VERY
SHORT TIME AND WITH REDUCED SUCCESS. SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE
WORK FORCE-THE VERY PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED AND COULD BEST PROFIT FROM
LIBRARIES-WILL NEVER HAVE EFFECTIVE LIBRARY ACCESS. THIS MAKES THE LIVES OF
MANY POORER AND MORE DIFFICULT; DENIES THEM SOME MEASURE OF SATISFACTION,
SUCCESS, AND HAPPINESS; AND ERODES SOCIETY'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CRITICAL
PROBLEMS AND GOVERN ITSELF. CHILDREN MUST LEARN READING, WRITING, ARITHMETIC,
AND LIBRARY USE TOGETHER.
