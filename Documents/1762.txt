IDENTIFIES THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF INFORMATION ACTIVITY AS ISSUE,

PROVISION AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND ACTIVE WAY OF INFORMING USERS. SUCH A
CHANGE WILL INCREASE THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE USER'S RESEARCH AND

THAT INFORMATION ORGANS OF ALL PARTS OF THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM MUST CARRY OUT INFORMATION PROVISION ONLY.
