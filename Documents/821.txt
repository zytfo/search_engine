CONSERVATION IN MUSIC LIBRARIES.

AN UPDATED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AS A JOINT REPORT TO THE RESEARCH
LIBRARIES COMMISSION AT THE 11TH CONGRESS OF THE IAML, MAINZ, 1977. DISCUSSES
HOW THE DETERIORATION OF BOOKS AND PAPER CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY'
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS; THE INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIALS USED;
MECHANICAL FACTORS (I.E. GENERAL WEAR AND TEAR); AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
(ATTACKS BY FUNGI, INSECTS, ETC.). DESCRIBES BRIEFLY SOME OF THE MAJOR
CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DEACIDIFICATION AND LAMINATION. SUGGESTS A
NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS CAN INSTIGATE CONSERVATION MEASURES IN
THEIR OWN LIBRARIES, AND MENTIONS SOME REMEDIES THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED. NOTES
THE STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS SETTING UP INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL
COOPERATIVE PRESERVATION PROGRAMMES.
