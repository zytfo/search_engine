THE DARTMOUTH CATALOGUE SYSTEM-FIVE YEARS LATER.
     
DARTMOUTH REGIONAL LIBRARY (NOVA SCOTIA) HAS BEEN RUNNING A COMPUTERISED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR 5 YEARS. IT CONTAINS OVER 80,000 RECORDS PERTAINING TO
PRINTED, AUDIO-VISUAL, AND MICRO-FORMAT MATERIAL. CUMULATIVE CURRENT
ACQUISITIONS CATALOGUES ARE PRODUCED 8 TIMES A YEAR. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR,
THESE ARE MERGED WITH THE MASTER FILES AND A NEW COMPLETE CATALOGUE IS
PRODUCED. THE SYSTEM COSTS ARE 13 CENTS PER TITLE ADDED (THIS INCLUDES
EDITING, UPDATE, AND MAINTENANCE, BUT NOT INPUT CHARGES). THE SYSTEM HAS
PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND
EFFICIENCY ARE PLANNED.
