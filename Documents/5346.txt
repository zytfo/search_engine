A QUEUEING STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOG USE.

DISCUSSES A 6-WEEK QUEUING STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOGUES IN THE IOWA STATE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM. DATA GATHERED ARE ANALYSED PRIMARILY TO DETERMINE
IF ROUTINELY GATHERED LIBRARY STATISTICS CAN VALIDLY BE USED TO PREDICT
CATALOGUE USAGE, TO DISCOVER THE RATIO BETWEEN THE USAGE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE
AND THE SENATE CATALOGUE, AND TO PINPOINT THE TIME OF PEAK CARD CATALOGUE
USAGE IN ORDER TO MEASURE MORE CLOSELY THE RATE OF USE. THIS MEASUREMENT,
THEN, CAN PROVIDE 1 FACTOR IN A SIMULATION MODEL THAT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED TO
PREDICT ACCURATELY THE NUMBER OF DEVICES NEEDED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE
FORMAT.
