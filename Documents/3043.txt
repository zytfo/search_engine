LIBRARY EDUCATION FROM 3 PERSPECTIVES' COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC, AND
DEVELOPMENTAL.
     
LIBRARY EDUCATION HAS BEEN PART OF THE US HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM SINCE 1870.
IT REMAINED POPULAR UNTIL WORLD WAR II AND THEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN DROP IN
POPULARITY. IT WAS REVIVED ONLY IN THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 60S. ANALYSES THE
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN TERMS OF LEARNING, TEACHING, CURRICULUM AND
EVALUATION FROM COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVES.
DISCUSSES A 3 PART PROGRAMME WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED SUCESSFULLY
AT COLGATE UNIVERSITY. PROGRAMMES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF DENVER ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. THE EXPERIENCE
OF LIBRARIANS IS THAT IT IS EASY FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN THE BROADER CONCEPTS OF
THE USAGE OF THE LIBRARY AND DO RESEARCH, RATHER THAN REMEMBER MANY TITLES FOR
EACH SUBJECT OF THEIR RESEARCH.
