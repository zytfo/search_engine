DIACHRONOUS VS. SYNCHRONOUS STUDY OF OBSOLESCENCE.

(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN). A COMPARISON OF 2
WAYS OF MEASURING OBSOLESCENCE WITHIN THE SUBJECT OF HUMAN AND MEDICAL
GENETICS. SYNCHRONOUS STUDIES (WHICH ARE MADE ON RECORDS OF USE OR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES MADE AT 1 POINT IN TIME AND COMPARE THE USE AGAINST
THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIAL USED OR CITED) ARE MORE EASILY APPLIED
AND PRODUCE EQUIVALENT RESULTS TO THE APPARENTLY MORE THEORETICALLY DESIRABLE
DIACHRONOUS STUDIES (WHICH FOLLOW THE USE OF PARTICULAR ITEMS THROUGH
SUCCESSIVE OBSERVATIONS AT DIFFERENT DATES).
