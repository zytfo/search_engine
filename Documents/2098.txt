A BABEL OF CONCRETE.
     
REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY SERVICE TO IMMIGRANTS ORGANISED BY THE
DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, MAR 81, AND HELD IN ISHOJ, WHICH HAS DENMARK'S
LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF IMMIGRANTS WITH 50 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY A
POPULATION OF 21,000. THE MAYOR OF ISHOJ ARGUED THAT IMMIGRANTS MUST
ASSIMILATE AND LEARN DANISH, WHEREAS THE 3 IMMIGRANT SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
CHILDREN MUST LEARN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE PROPERLY BEFORE THEY CAN LEARN DANISH,
IF THEY ARE NOT TO BE CULTURALLY ISOLATED, KNOWING 2 LANGUAGES ONLY PARTLY.
BOOK PROVISION WAS 6 BOOKS PER DANE, BUT ONLY 1/2 PER IMMIGRANT. THE
LIBRARIANS PRESENT POINTED OUT THE ENORMITY OF THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
PROVISION TO IMMIGRANTS SPEAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AND ASKED FOR
MORE BILINGUAL LIBRARIANS AND CLOSER CONTACT WITH SCHOOLS ON MATTERS OF
LINGUISTIC BACKGROUND AND BOOK SELECTION.
