COMPARING FICHE AND FILM' A TEST OF SPEED.

SPEEDS OF SEARCHING MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE COM CATALOGUES WERE MEASURED AND
COMPARED. SEARCHING OF MOTORISED MICROFILM CATALOGUED WAS FOUND TO BE
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN SEARCHING MICROFICHE FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS. THE
SLOWEST FILM TIME WAS FASTER THAN MOST FICHE TIMES. RESULTS SUGGESTED,
HOWEVER, THAT FREQUENT USERS MIGHT IMPROVE THEIR SEARCHING TIMES AND MAY THEN
BE ABLE TO SEARCH FICHE FASTER THAN FILM.
