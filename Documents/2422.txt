DATABASE COMMUNICATION IN A HETEROGENOUS DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NETWORK.
     
AN ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH IS OUTLINED, TO FULFIL THE NEED FOR AN INTEGRATED
DATA BASE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ABLE TO SUPPORT ANY USER IN ANY NETWORK NODE,
WITHOUT INCURRING MASS MIGRATION OF DATA. A GLOBAL QUERY TRANSLATOR PROCESSES
QUERIES INTO A GLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF INFORMATION CONTENT, AND A GLOBAL
INTERNAL MODEL OF DATA TO FORM AN ACCESS-PATH ORIENTED MODEL OF THE STRUCTURE
OF THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM. SUB-QUERIES ARE FORMED USING A QUERY DECOMPOSER AND
ACCESS PATH SELECTORS, AND ARE TRANSLATED INTO THE DATA BASE LANGUAGE. THE
ROLE OF LAYERS AND MAPPINGS IN THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE IS DEFINED BETWEEN
THE VIRTUAL MODEL AND THE LOCAL PHYSICAL DATA BASE. THE ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP
AND DIAM-SDDT MODELS ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH GENERAL DATA BASE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN INTEGRATED NETWORK HETEROGENOUS DATA BASE
IS FOLLOWED BY A DESCRIPTION OF INTER-DATA BASE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE UNIFIED
GLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL.
