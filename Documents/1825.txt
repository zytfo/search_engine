LOCAL SYSTEMS' DESIGN AND COSTS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A LOCAL APPROACH TO THE
AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONS PROCESSES WAS, UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY, THE
ONLY ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE WELL
DOCUMENTED; COSTS ARE NOT. INVESTIGATES PITFALLS TO A LOCAL APPROACH AND LISTS
ALTERNATIVES. EXPLORES TRENDS SUCH AS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INTERFACE
WITH NATIONAL OR OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS, AND THE GREATER DEMANDS FOR MANAGERIAL
DATA. SUGGESTS THAT A LESS RIGID, TRADITIONAL APPROACH TOWARDS AUTOMATING
ACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE, AND THAT A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SHOULD PRECEDE A DECISION TO ADOPT OR
MAINTAIN A TOTALLY LOCAL APPROACH.
