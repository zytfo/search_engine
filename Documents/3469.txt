THE MICROWRITER.
     
CURRENTLY THE MICROWRITER IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW WAY OF WRITING IN ALMOST
ANY ENVIRONMENT, WITH ONLY 1 HAND, AND WITH THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY OF
BEING ABLE TO STORE, RETRIEVE, EDIT, FORMAT AND TRANSMIT WRITTEN INFORMATION
EITHER AS THE PRINTED WORD, OR IN CONVERTIBLE MACHINE LANGUAGE. SEPARATED FROM
THE MICROWRITER, THE 5 FINGER KEYBOARD COULD BE FITTED TO CONVENTIONAL
EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS TYPEWRITERS, WORD PROCESSING UNITS, TELEX AND COMPUTERS,
GIVING ACCESS TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND NEED TO
COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE EQUIPMENT, BUT ARE UNABLE TO MASTER THE
OPERATION OF THE QWERTY KEYBOARD EFFICIENTLY! IN THESE CASES THE MICROWRITER
KEYBOARD WILL BE A PERIPHERAL IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL KEYBOARD, AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EQUIPMENT WILL OPERATE IN THE NORMAL WAY.
