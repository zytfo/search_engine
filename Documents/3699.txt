COMPUTERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
A NORWEGIAN COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE (SEPT 80) DEFINED 2 MAIN PURPOSES OF
AUTOMATION' (1) LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES; (2) INDEXING,
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. NORWEGIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD
PROBABLY BEGIN WITH ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES AND PROCEED GRADUALLY, WHILE
DISCUSSING MAJOR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM; A
DECENTRALISED SYSTEM UTILISING CENTRAL SERVICES; LIBRARIES NOT USING COMPUTERS
THEMSELVES, BUT LARGELY DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERISED PRODUCTIONS. THE LIBRARY
CENTRE WILL EVENTUALLY ACT AS A DATA BASE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY LITERATURE AND A
CENTRE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY COMPUTER OPERATIONS. LOCAL SYSTEMS ARE VIABLE ONLY
FOR THE LARGEST LIBRARIES; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES MUST BE LINKED TO
A CENTRAL AUTHORITY, AND HENCE TO THE RESOURCES OF THE LARGE LIBRARIES. PUBLIC
LIBRARIES MUST FORMULATE THEIR OWN POLICY FOR AUTOMATION, EVALUATING SYSTEMS
ACCORDINGLY.
