STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SETTING.
     
THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE CRUCIAL IN DETERMINING THE SUCCESS OF ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES IN COPING WITH FUTURE DEMANDS AND CONSTRAINTS. ONE MAJOR ELEMENT IN
THIS EFFORT IS DEVELOPING AND EDUCATING EXISTING LIBRARY STAFF. RESULTS OF A
SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN 1979 TO FIND OUT HOW UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES RESPONDED TO
STAFF DEVELOPMENT, ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF A 1976 SURVEY. MAJOR SUBJECT AREAS
COVERED IN STAFF DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970S AS WELL AS FUTURE TOPICS ARE
IDENTIFIED. STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES STILL NEED
FURTHER GROWTH IN ORDER TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE
1980S.
