COPYRIGHT SHOULD REST ON AGREEMENTS NOT FORCE.
     
INTERVIEWS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW REVISION COMMITTEE, MOGENS
KOKTVEDGAARD. HE ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSALS CONTAIN NO CHANGE OF PRINCIPLE, BUT
THAT THE PROBLEM OF PROFESSIONAL COPYING OF MUSICAL WORKS ESPECIALLY HAS BEEN
TACKLED; MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR INFRINGEMENTS OF COPYRIGHT IS ENVISAGED.
PHOTOCOPYING OF PRINTED MATTER BY EDUCATIONAL AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IS BEING
BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITH BETTER SYSTEMS OF REPORTING USE. IT IS UP TO THE
ORGANISATIONS REPRESENTING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO PRODUCE A SYSTEM OF
COLLECTIVE ADMINISTRATION FOR DEALING WITH USERS. ABOLITION OF COPYRIGHT,
ARGUED BY THOSE WHO WANT A FREE MARKET IN CULTURAL PRODUCTS, WOULD LEAD TO THE
DEATH OF CULTURE. LICENCE AGREEMENTS ARE MUCH TO BE PREFERRED TO COMPULSORY
LICENCES. BUT SUCH A SYSTEM MUST BE COMBINED WITH FORMS OF STATE SUPPORT FOR
THE PRODUCERS.
