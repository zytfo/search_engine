CAMPANIA' ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARY SITUATION.
     
A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING SERVICES IN A SOUTHERN ITALIAN REGION
BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE IN NOV 80, SHOWING THE TOTAL INADEQUACY OF LIBRARY
PROVISION, AND ABSENCE OF ANY OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE
INITIATIVES AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY TO DEVELOP SERVICES AND PROVIDE
TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS. RELIABLE STATISTICS ARE UNAVAILABLE, BUT SUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH IN NAPLES AND THROUGHOUT THE
REGION, THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES ARE RESTRICTED TO UNIVERSITY USERS OR OTHER
PRIVILEGED GROUPS, AND PUBLIC ACCESS TO READING IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. ANY
ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED INITIATIVES, WITHOUT
RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE COMMUNITY;
EXPANSION IS HAPHAZARD AND THE CONCEPTS OF LIBRARY COOPERATION AND NETWORK
PLANNING UTTERLY UNKNOWN. SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE CREATION OF REGIONAL
CENTRES AS A 1ST STEP IN AMELIORATING THE SITUATI ON. A NOTE CALLS ATTENTION
TO THE INCREASED URGENCY FOR ACTION FOLLOWING DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS
BY EARTHQUAKE, AND AN APPENDIX DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS OF RESCUING ARCHIVES
NOW AT RISK BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE.
