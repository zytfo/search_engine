UTILIZATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) DATA BASES. APPLICATION FOR
THE IDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM.

A METHOD IS DEVELOPED DESCRIBING THE ECONOMIC UTILISATION OF THE CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS SERVICE DATA BASES; CA CONDENSATES AND CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SUBJECT
INDEX ALERT IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT THE DATA BASE OF THE
IDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATIONSYSTEM BUILT UP TO MEET THE PECULIARITIES OF
INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. THE METHOD CONSISTS OF EDP-PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES AT
WHICH SPECIAL AUTHORITY FILES FOR CODED COMPOUND AND SUBJECT ENTRIES PLAY AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL
EFFORT NECESSARY TO CREATE SUCH A DATA BASE IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM.
