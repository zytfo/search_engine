AUTHORITIES. TASKS SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND
THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DEALING WITH INTERLENDING AND
THE COLLEGE WITH MATERIAL FOR PROJECT ORIENTED TEACHING DEMANDING MULTIPLE
COPIES. DISCUSSES THE KIND OF MATERIAL WHICH SHOULD BE FOUND I N THE SENIOR
