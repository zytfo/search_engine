EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM FOR ONLINE ACCESS TO ACS PRIMARY DOCUMENTS.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE TYPESETS 16 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY PRIMARY
JOURNALS USING A COMPUTER-BASED COMPOSITION SYSTEM. IN THE PRODUCTION OF THESE
JOURNALS, AN ARCHIVED FILE CONSISTING OF THE TEXT AND SOME GRAPHIC DATA IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM IS GENERATED AS A BYPRODUCT. THE AVAILABILITY OF THE
ARCHIVED FILE HAS PROMPTED US TO INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICH IT MAY BE
ADVANTAGEOUSLY UTILISED IN THE FUTURE. DESCRIBES ONE ASPECT OF THIS
INVESTIGATION INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AN EXPERIMENTAL ON-LINE
PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO SELECT TEXTUAL SUBSETS OF PRIMARY
DOCUMENTS. THE PREPARATION OF ARTICLES FOR A SYNOPTIC JOURNAL IS ONE POSSIBLE
FUTURE APPLICATION OF THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. OTHER POSSIBLE FUTURE APPLICATIONS
OF THE DEVELOPED-TEXT ACCESS AND MANIPULATION FEATURES ARE MENTIONED.
