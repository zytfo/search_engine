STRUCTURE. ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL CATALOGUE ARE' IT LISTS MONOGRAPHS AND
PERIODICALS TOGETHER; PERIODICALS ARE GIVEN A SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION; THE
NOTATION IS EASIER TO REMEMBER THAN THAT USED IN THE MAIN CATALOGUE; THE
KEYWORDS ARE IN GERMAN; THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT PRODUCED BY USING THE NOTATION
IS SUITED TO THE STOCK.
