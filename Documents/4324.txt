EITHER WE MOVE OR ELSE WE STOP ACCEPTING MORE BOOKS.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEPOSIT LIBRARY AND ITS SPACE PROBLEMS. UNLESS THE LIBRARY MOVES
FROM ITS PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WITHIN
HALF A YEAR, IT WILL HAVE TO START REFUSING BOOKS FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
LIBRARY'S PURPOSE IS TO STORE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND TO LEND OR GIVE THEM TO OTHER LIBRARIES, AND THEREFORE IT MUST
NECESSARILY GROW AT A TIME WHEN OTHER LIBRARIES CONTRACT. THE LIBRARY BEGAN IN
1968 WITH 1400 SQ.M.; LATER A FURTHER 175 SQ.M. WERE ADDED FOR SHELVING AND
1000 SQ.M. IN A WAREHOUSE ELSEWHERE. A SUITABLE BUILDING OF 7700 SQ.M. IS NOW
AVAILABLE CHEAPLY. WITH AN INCREASE OF 25,000 VOLUMES A YEAR, THIS WOULD
SECURE ENOUGH SPACE UNTIL THE 90S. RUNNING COSTS WILL BE 5.1 MILLION KR. IN 82
AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT 3.6 MILLION KR., AND COST OF ESTABLISHMENT WILL BE
2.7 MILLION KR. THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBRAR Y COUNCIL HAVE NOW RECOMMENDED THAT THE MONEY
SHOULD COME FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' DISPOSITION FUND, NOT OTHERWISE USED
FOR SUCH PURPOSES, AS THE SOURCE OF THE LIBRARY'S FINANCE, THE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES' JOINT APPROPRIATION, WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE. THE LIBRARY IS A LAST
RESORT, AFTER THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE LENDING OF
OLDER BOOKS AND MEETS 55% OF ENQUIRIES, A FIGURE WHICH WOULD BE HIGHER IF A
CATALOGUE OF HOLDINGS EXISTED.
