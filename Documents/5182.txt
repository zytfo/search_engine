THE EFFECTIVITY OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUE.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION AND USE OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES MUST BE
OBSERVED IN ORDER THAT THE POSSIBLE RATIONALISATION EFFECTS MAY BE BEST USED.
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT PROBLEMS CAN ARISE THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES OF
MANIFOLD APPLICATION OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY BEST
SOLVED FROM THE ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW JUST BY THE USE OF SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.
MANUFACTURERS AND USERS OF MICROFILM EQUIPMENT MUST COOPERATE TO ACHIEVE AN
AGREEMENT ON THE PRODUCTION OF A RANGE OF EQUIPMENT SUITED TO ITS PURPOSES AND
ON LONG-TERM BASIC PRODUCTION MEASURES. METHODS OF ESTIMATING THE EFFECTIVITY
OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES ARE PRESENTED, WITH REGARD TO CURRENT SERVICE
EFFICIENCY, TYPES OF INFORMATION WORK CARRIED OUT, THE KIND, SIZE AND NUMBER
OF DOCUMENTS INVOLVED, THE RANGE OF USERS AND THE CALCULATION OF UNIT COSTS
AND POSSIBLE SAVINGS.
