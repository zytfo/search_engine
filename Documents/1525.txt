CONTINUALLY CHANGING.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE BORAS LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL, SWEDEN FOR 1979-80.
THE CHANGING FORMS OF THE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE QUESTION OF AN
EDUCATION FOR TUTOR LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED. WHEN REVIEWING THE CAPACITY OF
THE SCHOOL IT IS CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT RESPONDED WELL TO THE CHANGING LABOUR
MARKET, SOMETIMES PRODUCING OVER-, SOMETIMES UNDERCAPACITY. CRITICISES THE
PLANS FOR SEVERAL SHORTER TRAINING COURSES AS THEY MIGHT REDUCE INTEREST IN
THE 2-YEAR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSE. DISCUSSES ALSO WHETHER THE EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE GENERAL WITH SPECIALISATION AFTER A FOUNDATION COURSE,
AS THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES WANT, OR WHETHER SPECIALISED COURSES SHOULD BE
AVAILABLE EARLIER, AND ARGUES FOR MORE LIBRARIANS WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF
ADMINISTRATION, INFORMATION WORK, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, WHICH CANNOT BE
ACQUIRED THROUGH COSTLY IN-SERVICE TRAINING.
