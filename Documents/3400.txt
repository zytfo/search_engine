ON THE INCLUSIVENESS OF SYSTEMS FOR RETRIEVAL DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED
DESCRIPTORS.
     
ONE MEANS OF REDUCING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TIME IS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WHEN ONE KNOWS THE
SYSTEM RESPONSE TO A QUERY WHICH IS MORE GENERAL IN RELATION TO ANOTHER QUERY,
THEN IN AN INCLUSIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE TO THE
MORE SPECIFIC QUERY IT SUFFICES TO LIMIT THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS TO
THE SEARCH OF THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TO THE MORE GENERAL QUERY. DEMONSTRATES THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WHERE DOCUMENTS ARE
INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED DESCRIPTORS, AND IN WHICH QUERY SEARCH PATTERNS ARE
BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS OF DESCRIPTORS (SYSTEMS USING THE INVERTED FILE METHOD, THE
CANONICAL STRUCTURE FILE-METHOD, OR THE SEQUENTIAL FILE METHOD). THE PAPER
PRESENTS 3 METHODS FOR A DETERMINING A PARTIAL ORDERING RELATION ON A SET OF
BOOLEAN SEARCH PATTERNS OF QUERIES, IMPLYING A PARTIAL ORDERI NG ON THE SET OF
THE SYSTEM RESPONSES TO THESE QUERIES AND DISCUSSES THE ADEQUACY OF EACH
METHOD DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD USED.
