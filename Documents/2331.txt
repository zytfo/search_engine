THE AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS' A TWELVE-YEAR
PERSPECTIVE.
     
THE AFI WAS CREATED IN 1967 BY THE US NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND
HUMANITIES AS A PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT, NON-GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION TO SERVE THE
PUBLIC INTEREST. IN 1968 IT ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WHEREBY LC WOULD EXPAND ESTABLISHED PROGRAMMES TO
ACQUIRE, PRESERVE AND RETAIN MOTION PICTURES FOR THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF
MOTION PICTURES. THE AFI ALLOCATED FUNDS TO LC TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AND
TO AID ITS INSPECTION, HANDLING, CATALOGUING, PRESERVING AND STORING OF FILMS.
THE ARRANGEMENT HAS PERMITTED THE EVOLUTION OF A PRACTICAL WORKING
RELATIONSHIP WHEREBY EACH INSTITUTION DOES WHAT IT IS BEST SUITED TO.
DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE WORK OF BOTH BODIES, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN
COLLABORATION.
