PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A BOOK AND ITS INDEX AS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
THE RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE OF BOOK INDEXES CAN BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF THEIR
ABILITY TO DIRECT A USER SELECTIVELY TO TEXT MATERIAL WHOSE IDENTITY BUT NOT
LOCATION IS KNOWN. THE METHOD REQUIRES HUMAN SEARCHERS TO BASE THEIR SEARCHING
STRATEGIES ON ACTUAL PASSAGES FROM THE BOOK RATHER THAN ON TEST QUERIES,
NATURAL OR CONTRIVED. IT CIRCUMVENTS THE NEED FOR RELEVANCE JUDGMENT, BUT
STILL YIELDS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT CORRESPOND APPROXIMATELY TO THE
RECALL AND PRECISION RATIOS OF LARGE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM EVALUATION.
