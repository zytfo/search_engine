CORONADO'S RATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.

FRANCISCO DE PAULA CORONADO (1870-1946) DEVELOPED A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CUBA WHEN HE BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY IN 1920.
BASED ON A SIMPLE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL, CORONADO'S SYSTEM, WHICH HE CALLED
'RATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM', WAS ENTIRELY DERIVATIVE AND NEVER ATTRACTED
MUCH INTEREST.
