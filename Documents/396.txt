ON INFORMATION EQUIVALENCE OF DATA BASES.

USES AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF RELATIONAL DATA BASES. A
QUERY LANGUAGE BASED ON PREDICATE CALCULUS, A QUERY ALGEBRA, AN ALGEBRAIC
STRUCTURE ON THE SET OF CLASSES OF EQUIVALENT FORMULAE, AND A CORRESPONDING
RELATIONAL ALGEBRA ARE CONSTRUCTED. IN TERMS OF THESE, DEFINITIONS ARE GIVEN
FOR DATA BASE SCHEME AND SUBSCHEME, THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUBSCHEMES OF DIFFERENT
USERS, AND DATA BASE STATE.
