AUTHOR INDEXING.
     
INDEXING TERMS SUPPLIED BY AUTHORS CAN INCREASE SUBJECT CONTROL OF THEIR
DOCUMENTS. THE TERMS CAN BE USED IN THE CREATION OF INDEXES, ABSTRACTS, AND
OTHER DEVICES FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE SPECIAL LIBRARY. AN EXAMINATION
OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY AUTHOR INDEXING PROGRAMME SUGGESTS THAT
CONTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHORS ENHANCE THE INDEXING EFFORTS OF EDITORS.
