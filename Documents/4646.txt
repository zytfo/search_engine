POLITICAL LITERATURE IN SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES.
     
BEARING IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION OF EVERY SINGLE
CITIZEN IN A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, THE STAFF IN SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES ARE BOUND TO
PAY DUE ATTENTION TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL
SCIENCES. IT IS DESIRABLE TO SET UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE TO FIND WAYS
OF MAXIMISING THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL LITERATURE UPON READERS. RESOLUTE
POLICIES MUST BE PURSUED, STARTING WITH ACQUISITION, WHICH, IN PARTICULAR WITH
RESPECT TO FOREIGN POLITICAL LITERATURE, MUST BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE. CATALOGUING
AND BUILDING UP OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES MUST SATISFY THE READERS' NEEDS IN
SPEEDY CURRENT AWARENESS. EXHIBITIONS ON THE OCCASION OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL
ANNIVERSARIES AND TOPICAL EVENTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALISED READING AND
STUDY ROOMS, AND ALSO MORE INTENSE RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF POLITICAL
LITERATURE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS TO STUDY
THIS KIND OF LITERATURE PERMANENTLY AND TO BENE FIT BY IT IN THEIR
PROFESSIONAL CAREERS.
