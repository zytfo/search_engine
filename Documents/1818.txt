PRIVATIZATION' A NEW ARRANGEMENT FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
     
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS, CONFRONTED WITH THE REALITIES OF MANAGING WITH LESS,
SHOULD CONSIDER PRIVATISATION AS A COST-CUTTING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE DELIVERY
OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING WHICH SEPARATES THE ROLES OF
PROVIDER AND PRODUCER OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING COSTS THROUGH
COMPETITIVE BIDDING BY PRIVATE FIRMS OFFERING TO PRODUCE LIBRARY SERVICES.
EXAMINES THE PRIVATISATION ARRANGEMENT, REVIEWS ITS ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES, AND ITS APPLICATION TO 3 LIBRARY OPERATIONS' REFERENCE
SERVICES, SECURITY, AND CATALOGUING.
