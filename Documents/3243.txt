INFORMATION NEEDS, TASK ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION INPUTS TO TASKS.
     
PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING INFORMATION NEEDS OF RESEARCH AND
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORKERS, BASED ON TASK ANALYSIS. FROM INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED
IN 1976 AND 1977 WITH 24 UK WORKERS IN THIS FIELD, 2 INFORMATION INPUT
ANALYSES ARE CONSTRUCTED, INDICATING INFORMATION INPUTS IN BASIC RESEARCH AND
IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES. THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAN THEN
BE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY, SINCE THE INPUTS SHOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE
INFORMATION REQUIRED IN RESEARCH.
