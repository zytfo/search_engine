SOUND RECORDINGS AS SOURCES OF MUSICAL HISTORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE IAML ANNUAL CONFERENCE, 1-7 JULY 79, SALZBURG.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON ANALOGIC RECORDING OF ACOUSTICAL PHENOMENA FROM
EDISON'S PHONOGRAPH TO MODERN HI-FI EQUIPMENT. ONLY THOSE SOURCES WHICH OFFER
A RECORDING OF REAL SOUND HAVE THE SAME HISTORICAL STATUS AS WRITTEN OR
PRINTED SOURCES. AS SUCH, THE EDUCATION OF MUSIC HISTORIANS AND MUSIC
LIBRARIANS SHOULD INCLUDE THE SCHOLARLY STUDY AND EVALUATION OF RECORDINGS, SO
THAT STUDENTS MAY LEARN HOW TO DATE RECORDS. ACOUSTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE
PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION AND RECORDING OF SOUND IS INDISPENSABLE KNOWLEDGE FOR
THE MUSICOLOGIST WHO DOES NOT WISH TO IGNORE MUSIC'S MOST IMPORTANT RECENT
SOURCES-RECORDINGS.
