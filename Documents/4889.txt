APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET CLASSIFICATION SCHEME IN BULGARIA'S SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE 1970, WORK HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS TO GRADUALLY INTRODUCE THE SOVIET
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME (REFERRED TO AS BBK) INTO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES IN
BULGARIA. THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACHIEVING THIS TARGET HAS BEEN THAT OF
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL
COMMITTEE FOR CULTURE AND OTHER BODIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S STAFF HAVE BEEN
PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED IN TRANSLATING AND EDITING THE UNABRIDGED
30-VOLUME-BBK-VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FROM 1973-81. THE LARGE
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES WILL BE CATERED FOR WITH THIS EDITION. PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARIES IN SCHOOLS AND OTHERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH ABRIDGED VERSIONS
ADAPTED FOR THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS. VARIOUS GUIDE BOOKS, EITHER TRANSLATED FROM
RUSSIAN OR WRITTEN BY BULGARIAN EXPERTS, WILL ASSIST LIBRARIANS TO APPLY THE
BBK IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. AN ITEMISED ACCOUNT FOR INTRODUCING THE BBK IS
GIVEN; IT IS EMPHASISED, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE BBK IS THE ONLY
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON MARXISM-LENINISM.
