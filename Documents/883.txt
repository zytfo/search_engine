EXPERIENCES OF DESIGNING A DATA BASE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS INFORMATION USING AN
ENGLISH LANGUAGE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED USING A MANUAL SYSTEM TO MANAGE DATA GENERATED BY
CLINICAL TRIALS AT SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH, ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR HANDLING CLINICAL TRIALS' DATA, USING DATA BASE
TECHNIQUES, IS PRESENTED. THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THE BENEFITS GAINED
FROM USING BOTH HIERARCHICAL TREE AND NETWORK STRUCTURES ARE DISCUSSED. THE
DISCIPLINES ENFORCED BY A COMPUTER SYSTEM NECESSITATED SOME CHANGES IN THE
DESIGN OF THE DOCUMENTS USED TO RECORD THE RAW DATA. THESE CHANGES ARE
DESCRIBED. ABOUT HALF OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS' DATA ARE QUALITATIVE OR TEXTUAL,
AND THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN COMPUTERISING THIS TYPE OF DATA AND THEIR
SOLUTIONS ARE PRESENTED.
