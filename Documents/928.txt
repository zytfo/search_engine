A MEDLINE FEASIBILITY STUDY.

A MEDLINE FEASIBILITY STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE NORTHEASTERN CONSORTIUM FOR
HEALTH INFORMATION (NECHI) AND SPONSORED BY THE NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL MEDICAL
LIBRARY SERVICE. IT IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT MOST POTENTIAL USERS AND
SUPPORTERS OF MEDLINE WITHIN HOSPITALS ARE UNAWARE OF ITS USEFULNESS AND
APPLICATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE NECHI WITH AN EVALUATION
OF MEDLINE AS A FEASIBLE SERVICE BY ASCERTAINING THE NEED AND BY EVALUATING
THE USEFULNESS, SATISFACTION, AND COSTS OF THE SYSTEM. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED
SUFFICIENT USE OF MEDLINE TO JUSTIFY IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN NECHI AND IT
PROVIDED USEFUL DATA TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF MEDLINE IN EACH INSTITUTION.
