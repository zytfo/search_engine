MICROFORMS USE IN GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE.

PAPER PRESENTED AND THE MICROGRAPHICS IN BANKING AND INSURANCE SEMINAR,
BRISTOL, MAR 80. PRESENTS AN OUTLINE OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF THE
GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE COMPANY, A COMPOSITE INSURANCE COMPANY
DEALING IN ALL CLASSES OF INSURANCE. FOR LEGAL REASONS PAPER RECORDS ARE
IMPORTANT, SINCE, ALTHOUGH MICROFILM IS ACCEPTED BY COURTS, THE EVIDENCE ON IT
MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED. USE OF MICROFILM TO SAVE SPACE IN KEEPING RECORDS HAS TO
BE SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE. A PILOT SCHEME WAS LAUNCHED AT 5 BRANCHES, USING
16 OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SUITABLE TABULATIONS FOR MICROFILM. A REPORT ON
PROBLEMS IN THE USE OF MICROFILM WAS PRODUCED, HIGHLIGHTING RESISTANCE TO
CHANGE, AND CRITICISMS OF THE MICROREADER. A MODIFIED FRONT PROJECTION READER
WAS OBTAINED AND WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH ACCLAIM. THE CONVERSION OF COMPUTER
TABULATED OUTPUT TO COM IS REACHING ITS CONCLUSION, AND THE COMPANY IS NOW
LOOKING AT CONVENTIONAL MICROFILMING OF P APER RECORDS.
