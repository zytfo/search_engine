PUBLISHING IN THE AFRICAN LANGUAGE' PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.

CONSIDERS REASONS WHY MANY BOOKS PUBLISHED IN THE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGES
ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY
CONDUCTED AMONGST THE MAIN PUBLISHERS OF MATERIAL IN THE AFRICAN LANGUAGES,
AND CONCLUDES THAT ONLY BOOKS WHICH ARE PRESCRIBED READING FOR EXAMINATIONS
SELL IN LARGE NUMBERS. NOTES WITH REGRET THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CENTRE OR
LIBRARY IN AFRICA THAT IS SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTING CREATIVE WRITING IN THE
AFRICAN LANGUAGES. ATTITUDES TO BOOKS AND READING IN AFRICA ARE SEEN AS BEING
GOVERNED BY MANY SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS, AND AS BEING ALSO HEAVILY
AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF RETAIL OUTLETS OR LIBRARIES.
ARGUES THAT, WHILST THE AFRICAN BOOK PROFESSIONS HAVE A MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY,
THE INITIATIVE FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE MUST LARGELY COME FROM GOVERNMENT BACKED
PROGRAMMES, AND INITIATIVES BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE AID OF THE MEDIA.
