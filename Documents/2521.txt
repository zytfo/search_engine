THE STATE OF RESEARCH IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN QUEBEC' SURVEY
RESULTS.
     
IN ORDER TO FULFILL ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE MANDATE CONFERRED UPON IT IN
JUNE 79, THE RESEARCH COMMITTEE IN LIBRARIANSHIP CONDUCTED A SURVEY TO FIND
OUT WHETHER QUEBEC LIBRARIANS ARE RESEARCH-MINDED. THE 203 QUESTIONNAIRES
RECEIVED, STUDIED AND ANALYSED, GIVE WITNESS TO SOME INTERESTING PROJECTS AND
REALISATIONS. BUT GIVEN THE TIME AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL CLIMATE, ONE QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED' WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF
RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP IN QUEBEC?.
