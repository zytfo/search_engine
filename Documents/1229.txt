NEED FOR A MULTIPURPOSE CADASTRE.

THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR LAND INFORMATION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN
THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THE INCREASING INVOLVEMENT OF FEDERAL AGENCIES AND
PROGRAMMES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF LAND-INFORMATION SYSTEMS
INDUCED THE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO SUPPORT THIS STUDY. THE REPORT CONSIDERS THE
BASIC COMPONENTS (REFERENCE FRAME, BASE MAP, AND CADASTRAL OVERLAY) OF A
MULTIPURPOSE CADASTRE, WHICH, IF PROPERLY ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED, WOULD
PROVIDE THE COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR ALL LAND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
