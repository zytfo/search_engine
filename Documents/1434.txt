TEXT PASSAGE RETRIEVAL BASED ON COLON CLASSIFICATION' RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE.

A SET OF EXPERIMENTS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE COLON
CLASSIFICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION AND
RETRIEVAL OF PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM THE FULL TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. FULL TEXT
DATA BASES WERE CREATED IN 2 SUBJECT AREAS AND QUERIES SOLICITED FROM
SPECIALISTS IN EACH AREA. AN AUTOMATED FULL TEXT INDEXING SYSTEM, ALONG WITH 4
AUTOMATED PASSAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, WAS CREATED TO TEST THE VARIOUS FEATURES
OF THE COLON CLASSIFICATION. 2 BOOLEAN-BASED SYSTEMS AND 1 SIMPLE WORD
OCCURRENCE SYSTEM WERE CREATED IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE RETRIEVAL RESULTS
AGAINST TYPES OF SYSTEMS WHICH ARE IN MORE COMMON USE. THE SYSTEMS' RETRIEVAL
PERFORMANCES WERE MEASURED USING RECALL AND PRECISION AND THE MEAN EXPECTED
SEARCH LENGTH REDUCTION FACTORS. OVERALL, COLON-BASED SYSTEMS DID NOT PERFORM
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER SYSTEMS.
