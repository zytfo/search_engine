THE DANISH PUBLISHING WORLD ABROAD OR THE CHILDREN'S BOOK FAIR IN BOLOGNA 1981.
     
THE 1981 FAIR ILLUSTRATED THE MISERABLE NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY PUBLISHING BUT
WAS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 80% OF WHICH CONSISTS OF COMICS,
PICTURE-BOOKS AND COLOURED BOOKS, ALL IN POOR TASTE. CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN
GENERAL ARE AT A LOW LEVEL-THE TV SCREEN IN BOOK FORM-AND THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER COLOURS AND PICTURES SELL WHEREAS CULTURE DOES NOT. SCANDINAVIAN BOOK
PRODUCTION DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIETY, BREADTH
AND WELL-DEFINED TASTE BUT IS IN AN OBVIOUSLY SCANDINAVIAN STYLE. THE 1981
BOLOGNA FAIR WAS DULL, WITH LITTLE NEW OR OUTSTANDINGLY INTERESTING, AND
BUSINESS ALSO APPEARED TO BE POOR AND MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH JOINT
BOOK-PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. JOINT PRODUCTION ENABLES DANISH
PUBLISHERS TO ISSUE QUALITY PICTURE BOOKS BUT ALSO HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME THE
MEANS BY WHICH DANISH BOOKS CAN APPEAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
