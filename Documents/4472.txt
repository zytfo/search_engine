INTRODUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE PRESENT CONTENT,
LEVEL AND FRAMEWORK OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING IS UNSATISFACTORY'
CURRICULUM UNITS ARE NOT BUILT UPON EACH OTHER; THE SUBJECTS STUDIED ARE NOT
SEPARATED ENOUGH ON EACH LEVEL AND ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COORDINATED; AND THE
COMBINATION OF SUBJECTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEMANDS MADE ON LIBRARIES. THE
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GO ON TO WORK IN LIBRARIES IS NOT KNOWN. THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP.
