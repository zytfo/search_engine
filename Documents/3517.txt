PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
     
THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SCOTLAND WILL BE GREATLY ASSISTED BY
GOOD LEGISLATION TOGETHER WITH COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY
REVIEWED. OUTLINES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LIBRARY COOPERATION COMMITTEE OF THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND AND RECOMMENDS THE SETTING UP OF AN ADVISORY
PANEL SIMILAR TO THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH
COULD PROVIDE ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE TO AUTHORITIES IN FULFILLING THEIR
STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS. AN ADEQUATELY STAFFED SCOTTISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
WOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BACKUP FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD AND WOULD BE
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE OPINION OF THE PROFESSION MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY TO THE
SCOTTISH OFFICE AND A SCOTTISH LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL. STRESSES THE
INITIATIVE, COMMITMENT AND ABILITY NEEDED IN LIBRARIANS AT THE POINT OF
SERVICE.
