VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS-POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS INTO WORKPLACES HAS LED TO FEARS
OF DANGERS TO HEALTH. ALLEGED RADIATION HAZARDS HAVE NOT BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (CANADA) OR THE BRITISH
POST OFFICE. VISUAL AND GENERAL FATIGUE PROBLEMS MAY BE OVERCOME BY TESTS AND
CORRECTION OF OPERATORS' EYESIGHT, AND CORRECT DISTANCING OF SCREEN AND
KEYBOARD. THE WORKPLACE MUST PERMIT COMFORTABLE POSTURE FOR THE OPERATOR, WHO
SHOULD HAVE SPACE TO LOOK PAST THE TERMINAL AT A NON-CONTRASTING SURFACE.
