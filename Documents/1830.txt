JOURNAL ACQUISITION AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS IN A SPECIAL LIBRARY' A CASE STUDY.
     
BROOKES' MODEL, BASED ON TRADITIONAL BRADFORD'S APPROACH, AS A QUANTIFICATION
METHOD, HAS SOME LOOPHOLES WHICH CAN BE OVERCOME BY RANKING JOURNALS
CONSIDERING BOTH PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSCRIPTION COST. THIS PAPER REPORTS SUCH A
STUDY. THE MAJOR FINDINGS ARE 1) THIS METHOD IS A FURTHER IMPROVEMENT AND
RATIONALISATION OF BROOKES' METHOD AND TRADITIONAL BRADFORD'S APPROACH. 2)
THERE IS A STEADY DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF RUPEE IN TERMS OF YIELD OF RELEVANT
PAPERS AND THUS JOURNAL ACQUISITION REACHES THE POINT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS
AT A CERTAIN STAGE. 3) THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE 2 RANKED
LISTS.
