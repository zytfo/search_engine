A LIBRARY IS FOR THE PUBLIC.
     
US PUBLIC LIBRARIES REPRESENT THE IDEAL (GOALS WHICH ARE ALWAYS BEING PURSUED)
AND THE REAL (PRACTICES WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED LEST NIHILISM RESULT).
PRACTICALITY HAS REVEALED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE FOR ALL PEOPLE, INCLUDING
THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OF ALL RACES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF
LIBRARIES FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ALL, THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITHIN THE
LIBRARY, AND THE EXTENSION OF THE LIBRARY'S FACILITIES OUTSIDE ITS BUILDING.
IN THIS WAY, THE REAL IS REALISED AND THE IDEAL IS STILL PURSUED.
