USE OF THE LIBRARY RESERVE COLLECTION AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY.

UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE IF THE PATTERN OF USE OF LIBRARY RESERVE COLLECTIONS
FOUND AT OTHER COLLEGE LIBRARIES CONTINUES TO EXIST AT DEPAUW, THIS STUDY
FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ALL THE RESERVE COLLECTION ITEMS NEVER
CIRCULATED DURING THE ENTIRE SEMESTER, AND THAT 33% OF THE COLLECTION
CIRCULATED ONLY 1-5 TIMES DURING THAT PERIOD. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT LIBRARIANS
EXAMINE THEIR RESERVE COLLECTIONS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT
EXPENDED ON THEM, AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM DISCOURAGING MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF
THE LIBRARY. STATISTICAL TABLES AND REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
