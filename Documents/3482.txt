WHICH ROUTE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL?.
     
ELECTRONIC MAIL IS LIKELY TO BECOME A MAJOR BUSINESS APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT
FEW YEARS, BUT THE FORM IT WILL TAKE IS LESS CLEAR. SYSTEMS BASED AROUND
FACSIMILE OR COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSORS COULD BE POPULAR BECAUSE WHILE
TRANSMITTING LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY, THEY REQUIRE FEW
CHANGES TO EXISTING OFFICE PROCEDURES. COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SYSTEMS REQUIRE
CHANGES IN USER HABITS, BUT ALSO OFFER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, E.G. IMPROVED
MANAGERIAL EFFECTIVENESS AND A REDUCTION IN THE TIME SPENT ON CLERICAL TASKS.
