DOCUMENTATION ON THE IVORY COAST.
     
SUMMARY OF RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 1981 BY THE IVORY COAST NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY. PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
SITUATION OF THE IVORY COAST, THE MOST DEVELOPED OF THE FORMER AFRICAN
COLONIES. A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION SERVICES WAS EFFECTED TO
ESTABLISH WHETHER INFORMATION PROVISION PRODUCED DEVELOPMENT, OR RESULTED FROM
IT. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
NETWORK LINKS, EXPENDITURE, AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION POLICY. FORMAL AND
INFORMAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE ANALYSED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES, WHERE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE
COLLECTIONS IS NOT FULLY EXPLOITED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE RESOURCES, AS
COMPARED TO THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INFORMATION CENTRE, WHICH IS FINANCIALLY
WELL SUPPORTED. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY INCLUDE COOPERATION WITH
OTHER AFRICAN STATES, THE ELABORATION OF A COHERENT NATIONAL INFORMATION
POLICY, THE IMP OSITION OF CHARGES FOR INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THE
DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN INFORMATION USE. THE EVIDENCE, IT IS
CONCLUDED, SHOWS THAT DOCUMENTATION IS A PRODUCT OF DEVELOPMENT.
