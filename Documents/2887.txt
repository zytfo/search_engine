CHARTING OF DEWEY USERS IN NORWAY.
     
IN FEB 79 THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 179 PUBLIC AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES, ENQUIRING ABOUT THEIR USE OF DEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN
(NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY); EDITIONS USED; SIZE OF COLLECTIONS;
SUBJECT-HEADINGS LISTS USED; INDEXES REQUIRED; SUBJECT AREAS WHERE DEWEY DID
NOT MEET NORWEGIAN REQUIREMENTS; AND ADDITIONAL AIDS DESIRABLE. THE AIM WAS TO
CHART NORWEGIAN USE OF DEWEY AND OBTAIN HELP TOWARDS A NEW EDITION OF ARNESEN
AND IN THE COMMITTEE'S FUTURE WORK. OF 117 LIBRARIES WHICH REPLIED, 77 USED
DEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN, MANY SUPPLEMENTING ARNESEN FROM OTHER SOURCES. SEVERAL
LIBRARIES SPECIFIED PROBLEM FIELDS, ARNESEN BEING FOUND WEAKEST IN CLASSES
300, 700 AND 900. PROPOSALS INCLUDED MICROCARD INDEXES; CURRENT SUBJECT CARD
CATALOGUES; CLASSIFICATION ON PUBLICATION; AND PERIODICAL PUBLICATION WITH
CONTINUING UPDATING. THE SURVEY REVEALED A CLEAR NEED FOR A NEW, EXTENDED
EDITION OF ARNESEN, AND A LIKELY INCREASE IN INTEREST IN DEWEY, THE  STATE
LIBRARY COUNCIL HAVING RECOMMENDED DEWEY AND UDC AS NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
POLICY.
