AN OUTLINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SENCKENBERG LIBRARY IN FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN.

THE LIBRARY IS PART OF A FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED IN 1763 BY DR. JOHANN
CHRISTIAN SENCKENBERG. IN THE 19TH CENTURY, SEVERAL LEARNED SOCIETIES
AMALGAMATED THEIR LIBRARIES WITH IT; THE STOCKS, COMPRISING WORKS IN NATURAL
SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, WERE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY LOCAL DOCTORS AND MEMBERS OF
THE NEWLY FORMED ASSOCIATION. IN 1907 THE LIBRARY WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC;
NEW PREMISES WERE USED AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF EMPLOYED. AFTER A PERIOD OF
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY DURING WORLD WAR I, THE JOHANN-WOLFGANG-GOETHE UNIVERSITY
TOOK OVER FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE LIBRARY. IN 1947 A NEW AGREEMENT WAS MADE,
GIVING THE UNIVERSITY MORE POWERS IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND IN 1966 THE
LIBRARY WAS MOVED INTO NEW PREMISES WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
