STUDY.

DISCUSSES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN OF A WORLDWIDE NETWORK FOR
TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION, A PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUTHOR IN SPRING 79
UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ITS
PURPOSE WOULD BE 'TO PLACE INFORMATION SERVICES...AT THE DISPOSAL OF
PROBLEM-SOLVERS AND DECISION-MAKERS IN THE REALM OF NATIONAL SOCIOECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT'. ITS PRINCIPAL FUNCTION WOULD BE TO FORWARD AND STORE MESSAGES
BETWEEN SERVICES AND CLIENTELE, MAINLY BY COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SWITCHING. A
NETWORK STRUCTURE COMPRISING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY NODES IS SUGGESTED. A
3-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PHASE FOLLOWED BY A 4TH YEAR OF PILOT OPERATION AND
EVALUATION IS RECOMMENDED.
