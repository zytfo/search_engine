UNITED NATIONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (UNBIS).
     
THE UNITED NATIONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (UNBIS) WAS DEVELOPED TO
PROVIDE EXPANDED REFERENCE AND INFORMATION SERVICES AT THE UNITED NATIONS DAG
HAMMARSKJOLD LIBRARY IN NEW YORK, AND TO ACHIEVE COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL OF UN DOCUMENTARY AND EXTERNALLY-ACQUIRED MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THE
UN'S PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS COMPUTER-BASED
INTEGRATED ON-LINE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM
COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS BY FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION, USE OF A VOCABULARY ALIGNED WITH
OTHER MAJOR INTERNATIONAL LISTS AND THESAURI, AND ACHIEVING A 1-TO-1 MATCH OF
DATA ELEMENTS WITH THOSE USED BY THE EXISTING INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS. CURRENT AND PROPOSED UNBIS ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED.
