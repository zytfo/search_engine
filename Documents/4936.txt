A VILLAGE WITH ONLY THREE BOOKS.
     
DISCUSSES A SHORT STORY BY A CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WRITER DEPICTING A
FICTITIOUS BRAZILIAN VILLAGE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WHERE ONLY 3 BOOKS ARE
AVAILABLE, CONTRASTING THE CULTURAL DEPRIVATION OF THE VILLAGERS WITH THE RICH
LITERARY EXPERIENCE OF CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN EUROPEAN FICTION. CONSIDERS THE
DISTORTED VIEW OF REALITY PRESENTED BY THE 3 BOOKS IN COMBINATION, AND
COMMENTS ON THIS INADEQUACY OF LITERARY PROVISION AS TYPICAL OF THE TIME.
