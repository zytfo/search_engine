SUBSYSTEM 'FRAGMENT' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INTEGRAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.

A STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER FRAGMENTS, WHICH HAVE AN
INDEPENDENT MEANING AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF SPECIALISTS ARE
CONCERNED, CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. IT IS SHOWN THAT IT IS
POSSIBLE TO CREATE A FILE CALLED 'FRAGMENT' AND TO USE THIS FILE, TOGETHER
WITH DOCUMENTARY AND DATA FILES, TO PRODUCE AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
THE 'FRAGMENT' FILE REPRESENTS A NEW TYPE OF INFORMATION SERVICE' IN RESPONSE
TO ASPECT ENQUIRIES, A NUMBER OF RELEVANT FRAGMENTS CAN BE LOCATED WITHOUT
USING PRIMARY SOURCES. THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE SELECTION AND INDEXING
OF THE FRAGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED.
