MASSACHUSETTS ASSESSED ITS INFORMATION NEEDS AND CURRENTLY USED THE DATA

OF DYS IN DEVELOPING THE NEW SYSTEM WERE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DATA
AVAILABLE BY ADDING NEW DATA OR BY AGGREGATING EXISTING DATA IN NEW WAYS; TO
IMPROVE DATA CURRENTLY PRODUCED BY ENHANCING RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS,
USEFULNESS, AND AVAILABILITY; AND TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY OF DATA PRODUCTION BY
STREAMLINING DATA GATHERING, PROCESSING, AND REPORTING FOR BOTH MANUAL AND
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS.
