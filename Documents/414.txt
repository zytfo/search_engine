DEVELOPING DATABASES FOR ONLINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

THE EMERGENCE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES REPRESENTS A SHIFT FROM PROVIDING A
PHYSICAL ENTITY, A BOOK OR AN ARTICLE, TO THE MORE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF
PROVIDING OR TRANSFERRING INFORMATION. THE ROLE OF THE DATA BASE
DEVELOPER/ANALYST IN THAT SHIFT IS THAT OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
'CATALOGUER' RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE ACCESS POINTS SUPPORTED BY THE
DATA BASE'S CONTENTS, MUCH AS A TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CATALOGUER DEFINES,
DESCRIBES, AND CLASSIFIES THE INTELLECTUAL CONTENT OF A BOOK AND 'MAPS' IT
INTO THE LIBRARY'S CARD CATALOGUE. DESCRIBING THE TASKS REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING
A DATA BASE FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER.
