SOME LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF DUAL NATURE OF PATENT DOCUMENTATION.
     
LINGUISTIC EFFECTS OF CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN LEGAL AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF
PATENT INFORMATION ARE EXAMINED. LINGUISTIC METHODS OF FORMULATING THE
PATENTS' INDICATORS, VARIANTS OF THEIR AMALGAMATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN THE
LIMITED AND DISTINCTIVE PARTS OF THE FORMULA ARE DISCUSSED. SPECIAL ATTENTION
IS PAID TO THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN LINEAR AND STRUCTURAL ORDER OF PATENT
INDICATORS AND THEIR COMPONENTS. CRITERIA FOR OPTIMAL SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE ARE
INTRODUCED AND SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY OF THE FORMULA IS EVALUATED. THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTIC RECOMMENDATION ENABLING ONE TO
BUILD THE OPTIMAL FORMULA WITHOUT BREAKING GRAMMATICAL RULES, STYLE AND LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS IS STRESSED.
