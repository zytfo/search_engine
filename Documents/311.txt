DESIGNING OPTICAL MARK FORMS FOR REFERENCE STATISTICS.

DATA ARE RECORDED ON OPTICAL MARK FORMS USING A SOFT PENCIL TO PLACE A SERIES
OF MARKS IN SPECIFIED AREAS, A TECHNIQUE THAT IS COMMONLY USED ON EXAMINATION
ANSWER SHEETS. THE DATA ARE THEN AVAILABLE FOR COMPUTER TABULATION AND
ANALYSIS. REFERENCE-DESK STATISTICS CAN EFFICIENTLY BE COLLECTED IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM BY USING SUCH A TECHNIQUE. INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE
DESIGN OF AN OPTICAL MARK FORM IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH IMPORTANT SOFTWARE
CONSIDERATIONS. THE OVERRIDING CONCERN WHEN DESIGNING AN OPTICAL MARK FORM TO
BE USED AT THE REFERENCE DESK IS TO PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO RECORD ALL
NECESSARY INFORMATION WHILE REQUIRING AS FEW MARKS AS POSSIBLE. USEFUL DATA
CATEGORIES ARE IDENTIFIED, AND FIGURES ILLUSTRATE HOW DATA CAN BE RECORDED FOR
EACH CATEGORY. PRESENTS INFORMATION RESULTING FROM THE DESIGN AND USE OF SUCH
A PROGRAMME AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA.
