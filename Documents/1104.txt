ALTERNATIVE AND CONVENTIONAL PERIODICALS' DEFINITIONS AND COMMUNAL ATTITUDES.

DISCUSSES THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF SOME US RURAL COMMUNES DESIGNED TO
DETERMINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS OUTSIDE LIBRARIES, AND PREFERENCES FOR POPULAR,
ALTERNATIVE OR PROFESSIONAL/TRADE PERIODICALS. PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED A DESIRE
FOR GREATER REPRESENTATION IN LIBRARIES, BUT DID EVIDENCE SOME SATISFACTION
WITH, AND USE OF, OUTSIDE LIBRARIES. CONCLUDES THAT, AS EXPECTED ALTERNATIVE
LITERATURE WAS THE MOST RELEVANT. THE VALUE OF PROFESSIONAL/TRADE MATERIAL WAS
ALSO STRESSED, BUT ONLY ONE GROUP CONSIDERED THE POPULAR CATEGORY AT ALL
RELEVANT.
