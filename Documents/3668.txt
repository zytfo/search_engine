THE LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATIVE BODY: CLEAR GUIDELINES NOW!.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES CULTURAL COMMITTEES AS ADMINISTERING
LIBRARIES. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY COMMITTEES MAY SURVIVE, BUT AS EXCEPTIONS AND IN
CONFLICT WITH OFFICIAL POLICY. THE LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE IS UNSATISFACTORY. A
MINISTRY OF CHURCH AND EDUCATION DOCUMENT (1979) OUTLINES DIVISION OF
RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION. LIBRARIANS MUST
INSIST ON SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. IF THESE STIPULATIONS ARE UPHELD, AND
GUIDELINES DRAWN UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS, LIBRARIES MAY
SURVIVE.
