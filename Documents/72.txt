THE AIMS OF MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES.

DURING THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THE 20 YEARS' EXISTENCE OF MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE
IN FINLAND THIS SERVICE HAS BECOME OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE. THERE IS A
MOBILE LIBRARY STANDARD AND THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS SET UP A
MOBILE LIBRARY WORKING GROUP. TRAINING OF DRIVERS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED ALTHOUGH
THEY DEAL WITH THE BULK OF THE LOANS. THE MOBILES, UNTIL THE INTRODUCTION OF
THE STANDARD, WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND WASTEFUL IN ENERGY, AND HAD A SHORT LIFE.
THIS YEAR 4.5 MILLION F MARKS WILL BE SPENT ON NEW MOBILES BY ABOUT 12 LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. 40 AUTHORITIES HAVE APPLIED FOR A GRANT. THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF
A MOBILE SERVICE NEED DEVELOPING: IMPROVED SERVICES AND THEIR RATIONALISATION,
TRAINING OF DRIVERS, COOPERATIVE PURCHASE OF MOBILES BY 2 OR MORE AUTHORITIES.
