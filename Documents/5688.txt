EXTRA-MURAL FUNCTIONS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

FOR OVER 10 YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE ACADEMIC LITERATURE
THAN BEFORE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES TO
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. THIS EXTRA-MURAL WORK MUST NOT BE REDUCED
BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACADEMIC MATERIAL MUST BE
SATISFIED AND INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND PURCHASING SCHEMES MUST RESULT IN A
BETTER COORDINATED AND MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF LITERATURE. THE BUILDING UP OF
UNION CATALOGUES USING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND OF DECENTRALISED
MICROFICHE AND SCREEN TEXT SERVICES WILL EASE THE DEMAND ON UNIVERSITY SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. ISOLATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WILL NOT IMPROVE THEIR PUBLIC
IMAGE AND COULD PROVE COSTLY.
