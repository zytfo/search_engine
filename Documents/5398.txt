SEARCHING THE MEDLARS FILE FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY.

BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NLM ON-LINE DATA BASES CLINIC, 11 FEB 81. AS
THE ELDERLY POPULATION IN THE US INCREASES, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) HAS CREATED A
GERIATRIC RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL CENTRES PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE CARE,
SUPPORT RESEARCH, AND TRAIN PRACTITIONERS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE. THROUGH THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE WADSWORTH VA MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY IN THIS PROGRAMME,
METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SEARCHING NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE
DATA BASES FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED;
TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN GERIATRICS ARE EXPLICATED; SAMPLE SEARCH REQUESTS ARE
EXPLORED; AND ON-LINE STRATEGIES ARE INDICATED.
