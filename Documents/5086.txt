PERIODICALS IN OUR LIBRARIES.

PERIODICALS ARE VALUABLE IN EVERY LIBRARY SINCE THEY ARE TOPICAL MATERIAL AND
ATTRACT NEW READERS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE USE THE LIBRARY. PERIODICAL
SELECTION IS IMPORTANT; A LIST IS INCLUDED OF 42 GERMAN LANGUAGE PERIODICALS
ON ALL SUBJECTS, FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED SUITABLE
FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH LIBRARY. PERIODICAL SELECTION BY A TEAM IS
ESSENTIAL; THE TEAM COULD INCLUDE THE PRIEST, THE PARISH COUNCIL AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. SELECTION SHOULD TAKE PARTICULAR
COMMUNITY INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT BUT EXCESSIVE SPECIALISATION SHOULD BE
AVOIDED. FINANCE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM; SOME INDIVIDUAL READERS MIGHT BE WILLING
TO HELP. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY'S PERIODICAL STOCKS.
