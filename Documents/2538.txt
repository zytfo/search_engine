ARCHIVIST AND COMPREHENSIVIST.
     
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE VASTLY EXPANDED THE ARCHIVAL REALM. THE
ARCHIVIST RISKS BEING OUT OF TUNE WITH THE NEEDS OF ELECTRONIC TIMES. TODAY
THE 'COMPLETE' ARCHIVIST IS REQUIRED TO PLAY AN EVER WIDENING
INTERDISCIPLINARY ROLE. THE SPECIALIST MUST NOW BECOME THE COMPREHENSIVIST WHO
CAN USE THE APPROPRIATE HARDWARE WITH ALL HIS WITS AND SENSES.
