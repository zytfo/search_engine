REFERENCE SERVICES AS A TEACHING FUNCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. REVIEWS SOME OF
THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE IDEA OF A TEACHING FUNCTION FOR REFERENCE
LIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD WITHIN THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION.
DESCRIBES THE WAY IN WHICH THE LIBRARIAN FULFILS HIS TEACHING ROLE ON A 1 TO 1
BASIS AT THE REFERENCE DESK, AND BY PREPARING VARIOUS KINDS OF USER GUIDES.
ARGUES THAT IN SCHOOL AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE
LIBRARIAN MUST BE INTENSIFIED BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES INHERENT
IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS. SUGGESTS THAT WITH DECREASING LIBRARY BUDGETS IN THE
1980S, LIBRARIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN REFERENCE SERVICES, WILL BE FACED WITH
JUSTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THAT A SUITABLE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE FOR
THE LIBRARY TO BECOME A 'TEACHING LIBRARY'.
