RESEARCH REPORT. CODOC REVISED: THE TREATMENT OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS AT
MONTREAL ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE.

DISCUSSES EXPERIENCE WITH THE CODOC AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR LOCAL TREATMENT OF
OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTLINED AND ITS
RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND INCONVENIENCES ANALYSED AND WEIGHED. AFTER 2 YEARS,
THE ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE WITHDREW FROM THE GROUP PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT
DISPARITY OF FORMS OF ENTRY FOR 1 SINGLE ORGANISATION, AND INSTEAD CREATED ITS
OWN APPROACH USING THE CATSS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. THE MODIFICATIONS MADE IN
ADAPTING ELEMENTS OF BOTH SYSTEMS TO MEET ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE REQUIREMENTS ARE
DESCRIBED, AND THE OPERATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM TO DATE EVALUATED.
