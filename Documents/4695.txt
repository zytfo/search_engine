LIBRARY SERVICE IN GREAT BRITAIN' STANDING FAST.
     
EXAMINES THE EFFECT ON LIBRARIES IN THE UK OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS. COMPARES THE SITUATION IN TOWER HAMLETS AND
LANCASHIRE, WHERE DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN LIBRARY SPENDING HAVE TAKEN PLACE,
WITH THAT IN CAMDEN, WHERE SPENDING HAS NOT BEEN CUT, BUT WHERE RATEPAYERS ARE
HAVING TO BEAR AN INCREASING LEVEL OF TAXATION FOR LIBRARIES AND OTHER
SERVICES. DESCRIBES HOW PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME IN 2 AUTHORITIES' IN
SUTTON WHERE REVENUE-RAISING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VIDEO GAMES HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED; AND IN BRENT, WHERE THE COMMUNITY BASED LIBRARY SERVICE, BECAUSE
OF ITS MAJOR COMMITMENT TO OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMES HAS BEEN
TREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. NOTES THE RESPONSE OF THE
UNIONS AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE SPENDING CUTS.
