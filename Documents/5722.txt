STAFFING IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS
IN NIGERIA SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF
SCHOLARSHIP AND RESEARCH, AND WHETHER THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS IN WHICH
STAFF WORK ARE CONDUCIVE TO EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. AMONG MAJOR
ELEMENTS EXAMINED WERE THE LIBRARIANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES;
THEIR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; JOB
SATISFACTION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL
DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE HAS BEEN HINDERED
BY THE INABILITY OF THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TO CONCEPTUALISE THE PROPER
ROLE OF A LIBRARIAN; RIGID BUREAUCRATISATION IN THE LIBRARIES; FAILURE TO
SEPARATE PROFESSIONAL FROM NON-PROFESSIONAL DUTIES; AND BY LIMITED INCENTIVES
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH.
