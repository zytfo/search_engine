COPYRIGHT COMPLIANCE IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES' A STATUS REPORT TWO YEARS
AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PL 94-553.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE US MEDICAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., JUNE 80. BRIEFLY REVIEWS DEVELOPMENTS
SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW US COPYRIGHT LAW (PL 94-553) IN JAN 78 AND
REPORTS ON A US-WIDE SURVEY OF ACADEMIC, HOSPITAL, AND SPECIAL HEALTH SCIENCES
LIBRARIES. THE LIBRARIES WERE ASKED TO REPORT ANONYMOUSLY ON THEIR CURRENT
POLICIES AND THE PROCEDURES USED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW LAW. THEY WERE ALSO
ASKED TO INDICATE ANY SPECIAL CONCERNS THEY HAVE WITH THE LAW OR THE
GUIDELINES THEY HAVE FOLLOWED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, US
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND THAT COMPLIANCE HAS
NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED LIBRARY SERVICES.
