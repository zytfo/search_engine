THE VIEWS THAT VARIOUS MEMBERS OF A SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITY MAY HAVE ON THE
PROVISION OF A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY ARE
EXPLORED. IDENTIFIES 3 GROUPS OF LIBRARY USERS' RATE-PAYER/LIBRARY MEMBERS,
RESIDENT NON-RATEPAYERS AND NON-RESIDENT LIBRARY MEMBERS, AND LOOKS AT THE
JUSTIFICATION FOR A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE TO EACH GROUP. HE CONCLUDES THAT THE
1ST GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE GIVEN A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICE BY A LOCAL AUTHORITY.
