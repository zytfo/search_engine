A HIGHLIGHT IN THE MIDDLE FRANCONIAN LIBRARY SCENE.

IN 1981 A NEW COMBINED GYMNASIUM (GRAMMAR SCHOOL) AND PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS
OPENED AT GUNZENHAUSEN, IN THE WEISSENBURG LIBRARY SYSTEM. SINCE THE OLD
PREMISES WERE TOO SMALL, A NEW LIBRARY WAS MADE FROM A FORMER HOSPITAL
BUILDING NEXT DOOR TO THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. NEAR THE ENTRANCE IS THE INFORMATION
CENTRE, WITH THE ISSUE SYSTEM AND 25 STUDY PLACES NEAR THE REFERENCE WORKS.
THE NON-FICTION, ARRANGED IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS AND THE AUDIO CENTRE, WHERE
CASSETTES AND MUSIC BOOKS ARE SHELVED TOGETHER, ARE NEARBY. A 2ND ROOM
CONTAINS ADULT FICTION AND LITERATURE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS. THERE
IS A SPECIAL SEATING AREA FOR CHILDREN, WITH HEADPHONE SETS AND TROUGHS FOR
PICTURE BOOKS. STOCKS TOTAL 18,000 VOLUMES.
