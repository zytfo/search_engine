ECONOMIES THAT AFFECT THE HEART OF THE SERVICE' A 2BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1
DISCUSSION ON ASSISTED LIBRARY BUDGETS.
     
REPORT OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN FRIEDRICH ANDRAE, KLAUS HOHLFELD, ULRICH THIEM,
HANS JOACHIM VOGT AND 2BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1 HELD AT THE GERMAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BREMEN, NOV 81. IT IS A LIBRARIAN'S JOB TO
PROMOTE THE USE OF BOOKS, A JOB WHICH MUST BE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVER
BEFORE. RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT 40% OF THE POPULATION ARE LIBRARY
USERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THAN
IN SERVICES; THIS DEMANDS MORE CENTRALISATION. IT IS BETTER TO PUT BOOKS IN
LAUNDRY BASKETS ON WINDOW LEDGES AND ON PAVEMENTS THAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROM
THE PUBLIC COMPLETELY OR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ONLY FOR RESTRICTED PERIODS.
LIBRARIES MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE MASTERY OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS,
AN ARGUMENT WHICH POLITICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE.
