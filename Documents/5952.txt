OUTLINE OF A SOCIETY OF FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

TODAY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN MANY FIELDS CAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES ALMOST
BEFORE SOCIETY HAS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. VERY OFTEN NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES OF CERTAIN INNOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED
BEFOREHAND. THIS HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF MANY COUNTER MOVEMENTS IN SOCIETY.
IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF 'ESTABLISHED'
AND 'ALTERNATIVE' STYLES OF LIVING, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF
INNOVATION IN SOCIETY. INITIATIVE, CREATIVITY AND COOPERATION, THE VITAL
FACTORS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INNOVATION, ARE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS,
ONLY OPINIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM DIFFER. TODAY A NEW
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION NETWORK IS GRADUALLY LINKING MANKIND. THE WORLD IS
BECOMING A 'GLOBAL VILLAGE' AT LEAST ON THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL
COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES. THIS NETWORK MAY ENABLE US TO PROGRESS TO A
RATIONAL WORLD MODEL IN WHICH EVERYONE WILL HAVE A CHANCE IN  LIFE.
