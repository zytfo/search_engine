PERSONAL REFERENCE COLLECTIONS AND ONLINE SEARCHING.

A MASSIVE NUMBER OF PERSONAL COLLECTIONS OF PAPERS AND REPORTS EXIST IN
MEDICINE AND A WIDE NUMBER OF OTHER SUBJECT AREAS. THE USEFULNESS OF THESE
COLLECTIONS COULD BE IMPROVED BY PROVIDING A LINK WITH THE LARGE ON-LINE
COLLECTIONS, INFORMING THE USER WHICH RETRIEVED REFERENCES WERE HELD IN HIS
OWN COLLECTION. THIS LINK COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH EXTRA LOCAL PROCESSING ON THE
SEARCH TERMINAL RESULTING IN IMPROVED CONFIDENCE IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS AND
INCREASED UTILISATION OF BOTH REMOTE AND PERSONAL COLLECTIONS.
