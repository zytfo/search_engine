THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
DESCRIBES THE FUNCTIONS AND EQUIPMENT OF THE FORECAST 'ELECTRONIC OFFICE' BY
CONSIDERING IN FUNDAMENTAL TERMS THE FUNCTIONS OF AN 'OFFICE' AND THE WAYS IN
WHICH MATURE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE DEPLOYED TO HELP
PEOPLE CARRY OUT SUCH FUNCTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT EVEN AFTER THE TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED, THE TIMING IS LIKELY TO BE DETERMINED BY A
COMMERCIAL STICK/SLIP PROCESS SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL
HAVE LITTLE IMPACT UPON NORMAL MODES OF OFFICE WORK BUT WHEN CHANGES START
OCCURRING THEY WILL PROCEED FURTHER AND FASTER THAN WE WOULD LIKE.
