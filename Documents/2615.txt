WHEN THE READERS DON'T COME' AN ATTEMPT AT INTEGRATING THE LIBRARY INTO AN
AREA OF URBAN RENEWAL.
     
THE ST. PAULI DISTRICT OF HAMBURG IS A SOCIALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED AREA WHERE
SLUM CLEARANCE IS TAKING PLACE. IN 1980, LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 20,000
VOLUMES OF WHICH 800 ARE TURKISH LITERATURE PROVIDED FOR THE MANY FOREIGN
RESIDENTS; THERE ARE ALSO GAMES AND GERMAN AND TURKISH CASSETTES. THE BOOK
TURNOVER IS BELOW THE AVERAGE FOR HAMBURG LIBRARIES. SINCE MANY ADULT
RESIDENTS EITHER UNDERSTOOD LITTLE GERMAN OR ARE CONFUSED BY THE LIBRARY'S
TECHNICAL PROCEDURES, FEW OF THEM USE THE LIBRARY. LOCAL CHILDREN TEND TO USE
THE LIBRARY AS A MEETING-PLACE, WHICH CAUSES NOISE BUT DOES PROVIDE SOMEWHERE
TO PLAY. THE LIBRARIAN, MOVING AWAY FROM PURELY TRADITIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP,
WORKS CLOSELY WITH LOCAL SOCIAL WORKERS, VISITING FAMILIES TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS
AND ALLOWING THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY FOR MEETINGS; THIS HELPS TO INTEGRATE THE
LIBRARY INTO THE COMMUNITY.
