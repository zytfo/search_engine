LIBRARY NETWORK IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AND ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

THE RECENT COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE 7TH 5-YEAR-PLAN
(1981-85) HAVE GIVEN A NEW IMPETUS TO THE WHOLE LIBRARY NETWORK IN SLOVAKIA.
SINCE 1 JAN 82, A SPECIAL SECTION OF MATICA SLOVENSKA, BASED IN BRATISLAVA,
HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. ITS STAFF HAVE TO WATCH, DIRECT AND CONTROL BOTH SHORT-
AND LONG-TERM PLANNING IN LIBRARIES. THEY WILL ALSO CARE FOR COORDINATION
BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC
INFORMATION. CONTACTS WITH LIBRARIES IN THE CZECH SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AS WELL
AS INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS WILL ALSO BE FURTHERED. THE OVERALL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARIES, HOWEVER, RESTS UPON THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF
CULTURE. FOR THEIR PART, THE MINISTRY'S OFFICIALS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT
TOWARDS UNIFICATION AND/OR STANDARDISATION OF ALL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES,
INCLUDING BUILDING UP BOOK COLLECTIONS, RECORDS, STATISTICS AND THE LIKE.
AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH MUST BE TACKLED IN  THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE ARE
COMPUTERISATION, MERGERS OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, WHERE APPROPRIATE,
AND INCORPORATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.
