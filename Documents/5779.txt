SURVEYS ON PRIVACY AND BIG BUSINESS, BANKING, AND INSURANCE.

THE SURVEYS, CONDUCTED BY THE SURVEY RESEARCH LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS, SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH POLICIES SAFEGUARDING
PERSONAL, FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. RESULTS
INDICATE THAT SOME LARGE US INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS HAVE INADEQUATE POLICIES
TO PROTECT SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE DATA FROM POSSIBLE ABUSE; THE IDEA THAT A
PERSON'S FINANCES ARE A PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN HIM AND HIS BANKER IS NO LONGER
TRUE; AND THAT MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE ADOPTED MANY PROTECTIONS
RECOMMENDED BY THE US PRIVACY PROTECTION STUDY COMMISSION AFTER AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S RECORD-KEEPING PRACTICES.
