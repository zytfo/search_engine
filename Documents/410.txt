PRESTEL: WHAT'S IN IT FOR LIBRARIANS?.

PRESTEL HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN LIBRARIES AS WELL AS HOMES, IN THAT PRESTEL DOES
WHAT LIBRARIANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE-STORING, ORGANISING AND RETRIEVING
INFORMATION. WHILST PUBLIC INTEREST IN PRESTEL HAS BEEN LIMITED, THERE IS HIGH
INTEREST IN THE LIBRARY WORLD. PRESTEL OFFERS MUCH OF RELEVANCE TO THE
REFERENCE LIBRARIAN'S WORK, AND MUCH OF VALUE FOR THE LIBRARY USER. DESCRIBES
A MARKET TRIAL OF PRESTEL IN 1978 AT THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ASTON,
WHICH PROVED THE SYSTEM TO BE GENERALLY SATISFACTORY AND COST-EFFECTIVE. IT
REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER PRESTEL WILL BE FOUND USEFUL ON A NATIONWIDE SCALE
IN UK LIBRARIES GENERALLY.
