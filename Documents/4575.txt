THE MINISTER HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY.
     
THE CONTRIBUTION BY A MEMBER OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE TO A DEBATE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HELD AT THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING, OCT 81. ARGUES THAT THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN
ITS LIBRARY BILL HAS DISREGARDED THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH LIBRARIES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1964 LIBRARY
ACT, A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE INCLUSION OF SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. THE IDEAL OF UNITY IS NOW BEING SET ASIDE. BUT IF THE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS, THE MINIMUM DEMAND TO ENSURE
THEIR EXISTENCE MUST BE BY-LAWS GOVERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND A SEPARATE BUDGET. THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THE
MINISTER OF CULTURE. YET THE LIBRARY BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THEM AND REDUCES
THE SEPARATE BUDGET TO AN ACCOUNTING ITEM IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES. THE
BILL IS, THEREFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE DANISH LI BRARY ASSOCIATION.
