ANALYSIS.

THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITIES IS REVIEWED. A RANDOM SAMPLE

IN NIGERIA IS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE MAIN GENERATORS OF NEW
TITLES FOR THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. CIRCULATION RECORDS OF THE BOOKS ARE
TRACED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING A WORKING COLLECTION MOST EFFECTIVELY
ARE MADE.
