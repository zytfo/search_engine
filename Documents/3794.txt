COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. I.
INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL STRATEGY.
     
THE STRATEGY OF AN APPROACH TO REPRESENTING AND SEARCHING THE GENERIC CHEMICAL
FORMULAS (MARKUSH FORMULAS) TYPICAL OF CHEMICAL PATENTS IS OUTLINED. THE
METHODS UNDER DEVELOPMENT INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING STAGES' (1) THE DESCRIPTION OF
GENERIC CHEMICAL EXPRESSIONS BY MEANS OF A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL; AN
APPROACH TO THE GENERATION AND RECOGNITION OF SUBSTITUENTS OR RADICALS DEFINED
BY GENERIC NOMENCLATURAL EXPRESSIONS, VIA FORMAL GRAMMARS; (3) METHODS FOR
AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF SCREEN CHARACTERISTICS, INDIVIDUALLY AND WITHIN THE
RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS DEFINED BY GENERIC FORMULAS; (4) SEARCH
TECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC STRUCTURES AND SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN
GENERIC FORMULAS BASED ON THESE METHODS.
