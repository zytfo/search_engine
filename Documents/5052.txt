LIBRARY WORK AT FACTORIES IN SLOVAKIA.

TRADES UNIONS PROVIDE LIBRARIES FOR FACTORY STAFF, ABOUT 10% OF WHICH ARE RUN
BY FULL OR PART-TIME STAFF AND THE REMAINDER BY VOLUNTEERS. THESE LIBRARIES
ARE SEPARATE FROM THE INDUSTRIAL TECHNICAL LIBRARIES WHICH CONCENTRATE ON
SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC MATERIAL. TRADES UNION LIBRARIES BEGAN AT
THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND IN 1948 A UNIFIED PLAN FOR THEIR ORGANISATION
AND MODERNISATION WAS BROUGHT IN. THEIR WORK IS COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL
TRADES UNION LIBRARY IN BRATISLAVA AND CLOSE COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES
IS MAINTAINED. MORE UNIFIED STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES ARE REQUIRED FOR LIBRARY
TECHNIQUES. THE LIBRARIES' CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL IMPORTANCE MUST BE
PUBLICISED AND MORE MONEY PROVIDED. STOCKS MUST BE MODERNISED AND MORE
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MATERIAL INCLUDED, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THERE
IS NO TECHNICAL LIBRARY.
