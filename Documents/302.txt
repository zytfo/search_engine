THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS).

SUGGESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS) HAS BEEN SO
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS DECIDED UPON IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN
HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME; THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS DECENTRALISED INPUT HAVE
BEEN MAXIMISED THROUGH DETAILED GUIDELINES, TRAINING, AND GOOD COMMUNICATIONS;
THERE IS A STRONG CENTRAL MANAGEMENT WHICH, THROUGH NATIONAL LIAISON OFFICERS,
IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO MEMBER STATES; AND THERE IS A STRONG SPIRIT OF GOODWILL
AND COOPERATION, GENERATING MUCH OF THE MOTIVATION.
