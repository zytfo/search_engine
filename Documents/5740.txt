ENERGY CONSERVATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS.

AT A TIME OF RAPIDLY RISING ENERGY COSTS ENERGY-CONSCIOUSNESS HAS BECOME A
NECESSITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS. AT MIERLO IN THE
NETHERLANDS A NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN NOV 81. BY THE INSERTION OF
EXTRA INSULATION IN THE FLOOR, WALLS AND ROOF, AND THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF
HEAT GENERATED BY THE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING IT IS EXPECTED THAT HEATING COSTS
FOR THE LIBRARY WILL BE 1/3 OF THE NORMAL AMOUNT FOR BUILDINGS OF SIMILAR
DIMENSIONS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF PREFABRICATED PARTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE LIBRARY ENABLED THE BUILDING TO BE COMPLETED IN 22 WEEKS WITH A CONSEQUENT
SAVING IN LABOUR COSTS.
