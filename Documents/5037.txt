INTAMEL CONFERENCE IN BUDAPEST, 1981.

26 LIBRARIES AND 12 COUNTRIES WERE REPRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF METROPOLITAN CITY LIBRARIES CONFERENCE. NEW PROJECTS FOR THE
COMING YEAR WILL INCLUDE COMPUTERISATION AND MAINTENANCE OF BASIC SERVICES IN
A TIME OF WORLD RECESSION. 2 MAIN CONFERENCE TOPICS WERE' ADVANTAGES OF
CENTRALISING THE STOCKS OF LARGE LIBRARIES, OR BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO SUBJECT
SPECIALISATIONS. DISCUSSION WAS BASED ON A PAPER PRODUCED BY THE HUNGARIAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE; AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS ORIGINATING FROM
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES-THIS VARIES WIDELY ACCORDING TO THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE,
BUT SOME LIBRARIES PRODUCE A GREAT DEAL OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. A VARIETY
OF VISITS DURING THE CONFERENCE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES
WERE MUCH INFLUENCED BY WESTERN DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT LIBRARIES WERE HEAVILY
USED.
