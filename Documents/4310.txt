MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE PRINT HANDICAPPED-MORE THAN RAMPS AND
SLIDING DOORS.
     
PRESENTS THE VIEW THAT THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED ARE EQUAL IN
SCOPE TO THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT LIBRARIANS SHOULD DEVELOP COLLECTIONS
IN THE FORMATS NECESSARY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. FOCUSES ON THE BASIC COMPONENTS
NECESSARY TO BUILDING AND ORGANISING COLLECTIONS AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS TO
BE ENCOUNTERED.
