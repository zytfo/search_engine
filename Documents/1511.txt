SOURCES OF ANTAGONISM TO 'QUALITATIVE' RESEARCH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. CONSIDERS WHY QUANTITATIVE METHODS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE MORE 'SCIENTIFIC', RIGOROUS, AND VALID THAN QUALITATIVE ONES AND ARGUES
THAT THE TERM 'QUALITATIVE' IS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RESEARCH WHICH
ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE
QUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL. SUGGESTS THAT CRITICISMS OF
QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ARE 'IDEOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GIVE SUPPORT TO
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS WHEREIN SOME CLASSES OR GROUPS (RESEARCH SPONSORS) TRY
TO EXERT CONTROL OVER OTHERS'. TYPICAL CRITICISMS OF SUCH RESEARCH ARE
ANALYSED TO EXPOSE THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.
