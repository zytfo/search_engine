REFERENCE SERVICE, REFERENCE LIBRARIAN AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
     
REFERENCE SERVICE IS DEFINED AS A DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
STAFF. REFERENCE LIBRARIANS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION.
THE MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE ENORMOUS OUTPUT OF LITERATURE. THE
REFERENCE LIBRARIAN NEEDS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SOURCES TO PROVIDE
THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT READER AT THE RIGHT TIME.
