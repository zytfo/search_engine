RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES: A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE
RECENTLY BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE KOMMISSIE KOORDINATIE NORMERING. THE COMMITTEE
WAS FORMED IN 1977 TO CONSOLIDATE AND EXPAND THE STANDARDS PROPOSED AT THE
MEETING OF THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR
LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) IN MAR OF THAT YEAR. THE COMITTEE HAS BEEN
CRITICISED FOR THE OMISSION OF A THEORETICAL BASIS TO THE REPORT. HOWEVER, AS
THESE ARE THE FIRST STANDARDS TO BE PUBLISHED, THE COMMITTEE HOPES THAT THEY
WILL FORM THE THEORETICAL BASIS IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS. IT ALSO INTENDS TO
INCORPORATE THE CRITICISM LEVELLED AT THE REPORT IN A FUTURE REVISION.
