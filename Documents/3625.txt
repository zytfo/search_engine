TOWN, SO THAT THEIR NEEDS MUST BE CATERED FOR BY BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
STUDENTS FROM COLOGNE AND AACHEN UNIVERSITIES ALSO MAKE USE OF BONN'S LIBRARY
SERVICES. IF A STUDENT CANNOT FIND THE REQUIRED MATERIAL IN THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY HE TURNS TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR HELP. IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HE
FINDS THE ADVANTAGES OF LONG OPENING HOURS AND OF ALL MEDIA ON OPEN ACCESS. IN
