INFORMATION SERVICE ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL SUBJECT COLLECTION LIBRARIES AND
CENTRAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES.

IN 1973 THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION) MADE
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE LIBRARIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF
SUPER-REGIONAL LIBRARY PROVISION. ALTHOUGH STANDARDS GENERALLY HAVE RISEN
SINCE THEN, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON ACQUIRING EXAMINATION SYLLABUS LITERATURE AT THE
EXPENSE OF RESEARCH MATERIAL. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE PROVIDING TOPICAL AND
COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SERVICES ON THEIR SPECIALISED SUBJECTS AND A
CLEARING HOUSE IS NEEDED TO SORT OUT THE EXISTING JUNGLE OF INFORMATION
SOURCES. CURRENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE DISCUSSED FOR'
PERIODICAL INDEXING; SUBJECT CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS; SUBJECT CATALOGUES OF
LIBRARIES; CURRENT SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHIES; AND ACQUISITIONS LISTS.
