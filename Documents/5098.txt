USE OF MICROFILM IN FRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES. THIRTY-FIVE YEARS' EXPERIENCE.

FOLLOWING A PRELIMINARY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM IN
FRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES AND ITS GRADUAL INTEGRATION INTO NORMAL ARCHIVE
MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE ELABORATION OF OFFICIAL NORMS AND
REGULATIONS FOR USE, STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
SERVICE IS GIVEN, SHOWING PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN WORKSHOP SPACE, SPECIALIST
PERSONNEL EMPLOYED, AND MICROFILM FOOTAGE PRODUCTION, WITH REFERENCE TO
RELEVANT STATE PUBLICATIONS. THE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMME OF DUPLICATING
IMPORTANT HOLDINGS IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND COMMENTS MADE ON ATTITUDES IN
GENERAL TO USE OF MICROFILM, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. CONCLUDES THAT TO MAINTAIN
EFFICIENCY, THE FRENCH ARCHIVE SERVICE NEEDS TO KEEP ABREAST OF TECHNOLOGICAL
DEVELOPMENT, SECURE ITS FINANCIAL BASIS, AND SOLVE THE LEGAL PROBLEMS OF
REPROGRAPHY.
