IN-SERVICE QUALIFICATION AT THE WAB(B) POTSDAM.

IN MANY LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES THERE ARE UNQUALIFIED STAFF IN SPECIALIST
POSTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO STUDY FOR PROFESSIONAL
QUALIFICATIONS. SINCE 1979 POTSDAM RESEARCH LIBRARY HAS ORGANISED SPECIAL
IN-SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR THEM, INCLUDING GENERAL SURVEYS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR AND SPECIALIST TRAINING IN
THE WORK OF THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS. AT THE END OF THE 12 MONTHS' COURSE EACH
STUDENT RECEIVES A CERTIFICATE OF PARTICIPATION. IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR STAFF TO
HAVE PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO GIVE THEM
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE AND TO GET FROM THEM A PROMISE TO WORK HARD.
EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT MOST STUDENTS FIND THE COURSE HELPFUL. THIS TYPE OF
COURSE CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED IN A LARGE LIBRARY SYSTEM.
