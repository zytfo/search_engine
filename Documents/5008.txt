LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES. THE SURVEY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE PERCEPTION
RANKINGS OF EXCELLENCE IN 4 CATEGORIES' QUALITY OF MASTER'S PROGRAMME, QUALITY
OF DOCTORAL PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF EDUCATORS, QUALITY OF DOCTORAL
PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATORS, AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE
PROFESSION BY THE FACULTY AS A WHOLE. RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
EARLIER, SMALLER SAMPLE STUDIES, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO
