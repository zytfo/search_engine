THE CONSERVATION OF THE FRENCH DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE.
     
AMONG THE MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THE PAST BROUGHT TO LIGHT DURING HERITAGE YEAR
IN FRANCE (1980), THE BOOK, IN MANUSCRIPT AND PRINT FORMS, IN PUBLIC OR
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS, OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED BY A NATIONAL CONSERVATION POLICY.
ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF PARTIAL INVENTORIES EXIST, SUCH A POLICY CANNOT BE
MAINTAINED AT PRESENT IN FRANCE WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL INVENTORY.
APART FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, WHICH HAS SPECIALISED RESTORATION FACILITIES
AND A DEPARTMENT FOR THE PREVENTION AND DETECTION OF DAMAGED DOCUMENTS,
LIBRARIES RARELY HAVE THE MEANS TO ASSURE THE MATERIAL PROTECTION OF
DOCUMENTS. THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL HERITAGE SHOULD EXTEND TO THE
SELECTION OF 20TH CENTURY DOCUMENTS.
