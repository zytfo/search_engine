SOME QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY TRAINING, RELATION OF UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOL

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LIBRARY TRAINING SHOULD
BE BASED ON THE PROFESSION AND NOT ON THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES. GENERAL
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SHOULD BE OFFERED RATHER THAN SPECIALIST TRAINING. THE

OBJECTIVES. HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY TRAINING SHOULD BE SEPARATE, BUT
CONNECTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT CROSSING FROM 1 TO THE OTHER IS MADE EASIER.
