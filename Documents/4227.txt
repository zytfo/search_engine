THE ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.
     
USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS A
NATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESS
DEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONS
MAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE AT
LYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLE
OF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.
FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL
STANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OF
INDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FOR
INSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARY
SPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THE
LIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHER
ORGANISATIONS.
