DOWNHILL ALL THE WAY: PUBLISHING IN THE 80S.

DISCUSSES (WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO AUSTRALIA) THE RISING COST OF
PUBLISHING, MARKETING, AND DISTRIBUTING BOOKS; THE EFFECTS OF BUYER RESISTANCE
TO HIGH PRICES (EVER MORE BOOKS REMAINDERED OR PULPED); PRESSURES ON SCHOLARLY
BOOK PUBLISHERS; THE NEED FOR PUBLISHERS TO KNOW THEIR CUSTOMERS AND CAREFULLY
EVALUATE THE MARKET FOR EACH BOOK; AND THE PLIGHT OF EDUCATIONAL AND TRADE
PUBLISHERS. PREDICTS THAT THOSE PUBLISHERS WHO WANT TO SURVIVE BEYOND THE
1980S WILL NEED TO START LOOKING NOW AT WHAT THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION WILL
MEAN FOR THEM.
