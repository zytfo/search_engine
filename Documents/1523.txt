THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF LIBRARIANS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS HAS NOT IMPROVED IN ITALY DURING THE
LAST 50 YEARS. UNIVERSITY REFORM HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
ORGANISATION IN RESPECT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING. LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKE
DEGREE COURSES IN THE SPECIFIC DISCIPLINES OF THE CULTURAL AREAS SERVED BY THE
LIBRARIES IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO WORK. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION CANNOT BE
CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. LIBRARIANS LACKING
THE CAPACITY TO ORGANISE A LIBRARY ON TRADITIONAL LINES WILL NOT PROFIT MUCH
FROM THE ASSISTANCE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD RATIONALISE
ITS OWN LIBRARIES AND CONCENTRATE ITS INTERNAL SERVICES AT ALL LEVELS ON
SATISFYING THE REQUESTS OF ALL POTENTIAL READERS.
