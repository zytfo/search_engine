GOVERNMENT PRINTING REFORM' AN INDEPENDENT MANAGERIAL PERSPECTIVE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING REFORM. THERE IS NO MANAGERIAL PRECEPT TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT
ANOMALY OF CONGRESSIONAL OPERATION AND CONTROL OF FEDERAL PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING MATTERS OTHER THAN FOR THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY CONGRESS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRINTING REFORM
LEGISLATION PROMISE TO PERPETUATE THE BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCES, SQUABBLING,
RED TAPE, AND SUBTERFUGES PREVALENT IN THE PRINTING AND PUBLISHING POLICY
SYSTEM. REMEDIES WHICH SHOULD BE PURSUED INCLUDE REMOVING CONGRESSIONAL
INTRUSION IN THESE MATTERS AND ESTABLISHING CENTRAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
