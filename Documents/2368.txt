CATALOGUES AND A DECENTRALISED COMPUTER SYSTEM1' SWEDISH VIEWS ON A DANISH
REPORT.D
     
ISCUSSES A REPORT BY A DANISH WORKING PARTY ON CATALOGUE PRODUCTS, PUBLISHED
IN 1980, AND COMPARES THE DANISH AND SWEDISH SOLUTIONS. THE PROPOSED DANISH
SYSTEM CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A MIXTURE OF LIBRIS AND BUMS AND CONSIDERABLE
CENTRAL GUIDANCE BY THE LIBRARY CENTRE IS ASSUMED. THE WORKING PARTY SEEMS TO
HAVE LITTLE FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO CATALOGUE
ACCORDING TO THE NORMS, FOR IT PROPOSES THAT CENTRAL LIBRARIES HELP THE
SMALLER LIBRARIES WITH THE DECENTRALISED INPUT. THE COSTS OF THIS SYSTEM ARE,
HOWEVER, HIGH, AND THE SWEDISH SYSTEM, WHERE THE LIBRARY SERVICE CATALOGUES
FROM PHOTOCOPIED TITLE PAGES THOSE TITLES NOT FOUND IN THE CENTRAL DATA BASE,
IS PREFERABLE. CRITICISES THE REPORT FOR NOT CARRYING OUT ECONOMIC COSTING OF
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORT EXAGGERATES THE
COSTS OF PRODUCING LOCAL CATALOGUES IN PRINTED FORM AND NEGLECTS TO CONSIDER
USE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY, E.G. LASER PRINTERS, FOR THIS PRODUCTION.
