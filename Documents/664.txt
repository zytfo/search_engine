LOCAL AUTHORITY LIBRARY PLANNING CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO PROVIDE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE AREA SHOULD BE COVERED BY A LIBRARY NETWORK, INVOLVING COOPERATION
NOT ONLY WITH OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT ALSO WITH OTHER LIBRARY
ADMINISTRATORS, E.G. THE CHURCHES AND INDUSTRY. LIBRARIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT
AS COMMUNITY MEETING-PLACES AND AS EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL CENTRES. IN MANY
AREAS MINIMUM STANDARDS OF LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT YET BEEN ATTAINED. SOME
PEOPLE CALL FOR STATE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE LIBRARY SERVICE BUT THIS
WOULD CAUSE TOO MANY COMPLICATIONS. CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE
DISTINGUISHED BY ITS AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM FROM COMPULSION BY THE STATE.
