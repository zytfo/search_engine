THE PROBLEM OF EXPRESSING INFORMATION NEED IN A USER'S INQUIRY TO AN AUTOMATIC
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
ANALYSES THE DRAWBACKS OF THE TRADITIONAL COMPOSITION OF A THEMATIC INQUIRY IN
AN AUTOMATIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR AN
ADEQUATE REFLECTION OF THE SPECIALIST'S INFORMATION NEEDS IN AN INQUIRY. SHOWS
THAT THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED BY THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO A
TRADITIONALLY-COMPOSED INQUIRY ARE NOT NECESSARILY PERTINENT, SINCE THE
CRITERIA EMPLOYED BY THE USER WHEN ANALYSING AND EVALUATING DOCUMENTS ARE NOT
INCLUDED IN THE INQUIRY TEXT AS RETRIEVAL CHARACTERISTICS. INTRODUCES THE
CONCEPTS OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION NEEDS AND 'RETRIEVAL
INFORMATION NEED'. CONSIDERS THE PROBLEM OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPOSITION OF
PERTINENCE CRITERIA AND THEIR FORMULATION IN AN INQUIRY. PROPOSES THE
CLASSIFICATION OF PERTINENCE CRITERIA.
