A USER STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOGS' A QUEUING APPROACH.
     
AS A MEANS OF STUDYING THE PRESENT PUBLIC CATALOGUES AND POSSIBLE CATALOGUE
FORMAT ALTERNATIVES AT THE IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, A 6-WEEK STUDY WAS
CONDUCTED. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE (1) TO DETERMINE THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN OTHER LIBRARY STATISTICS (E.G., DOOR COUNTS AND CIRCULATION RECORDS)
AND USE OF THE PUBLIC CATALOGUES; (2) TO CALCULATE THE RATIO BETWEEN USE OF
THE CARD CATALOGUE AND THE SEPARATE SERIALS CATALOGUE, (3) TO COMPARE THE
LIBRARY STAFF'S USE OF THE CATALOGUE WITH USE BY THE PUBLIC; AND (4) TO OBTAIN
INFORMATION ABOUT USE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE AND THE SERIALS CATALOGUE IN EACH
OF SEVERAL AUTONOMOUS LIBRARY SERVICE POINTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
