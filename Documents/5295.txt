COPING WITH THE CUTS.

THE RECENT FALL OF THE POUND AGAINST THE DOLLAR HAS AGGRAVATED THE SAVAGE
DECLINE IN UK POLYTECHNIC AND UNIVERSITY INCOME AS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF
PERIODICALS ARE OF NORTH AMERICAN ORIGIN. CRITICISES THE TRESS BRAUN INDEX SET
UP BY THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION TO MONITOR PRICE INCREASES. SUGGESTS
THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR LIBRARIANS' NEVER SEPARATE PERIODICAL COMMITMENT
FROM MONOGRAPH SPENDING; NEVER RUN A DEFICIT; AND ALWAYS KNOW WHAT NEXT YEAR'S
BUDGET WILL BE; AND BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR UNEXPECTED PRICE RISES. LOOKS AT THE
GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF 2 MODEL CASE STUDIES. LIBRARIANS SHOULD COMPARE PRICES
OF MATERIALS THROUGH DIFFERENT AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS TO GET THE BEST DEAL.
