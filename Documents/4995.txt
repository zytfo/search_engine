WHO IS KING RESEARCH AND WHY ARE THEY SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS ABOUT US?.
     
DETAILED REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF KING RESEARCH, INC.
(KRI), DATA ANALYSTS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, BASED IN ROCKVILLE,
MARYLAND. ALTHOUGH KRI SOMETIMES INITIATES ITS OWN RESEARCH PROJECTS, IT
USUALLY BASES ITS WORK ON REQUESTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND ASSOCIATIONS, SUCH
AS THE US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. IF A
REQUEST LOOKS INTERESTING, KRI PREPARES A PROPOSAL INDICATING WHY IT, RATHER
THAN ITS COMPETITORS, SHOULD CONDUCT THE RESEARCH, AND IN THE AVERAGE MONTH
THE COMPANY HANDLES MORE THAN 15 PROJECTS, WITH MOST STAFF MEMBERS WORKING ON
SEVERAL PROJECTS AT ONCE.
