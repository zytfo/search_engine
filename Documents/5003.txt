A SEARCH FOR INFORMATION MAN.

EXAMINES THE NOTION OF 'INFORMATION MAN' BY ANALOGY WITH 'ECONOMIC MAN' AND
SEEKS TO DISCOVER HOW THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN USED IMPLICITLY IN USER STUDIES AND
BIBLIOMETRICS. THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED THAT A PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF
INFORMATION MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN SUCH STUDIES AND THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE
EXAMINED. MORE SOPHISTICATED VERSIONS OF INFORMATION MAN ARE SEEN TO BE
EMERGING FROM SOME RECENT WORK.
