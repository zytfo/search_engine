ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE' AN EXAMPLE OF ROYAL BAVARIAN INDEPENDENCE.

THE ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE WAS FOUNDED IN 1901 AS AN EDUCATIONAL ORGANISATION
FOR PUBLISHING NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS AND CONTROLLING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA. EACH PARISH LIBRARY IS SUBORDINATE TO ITS
DIOCESAN CENTRE AND THE STATE LIBRARY CENTRE PROVIDES A NUMBER OF CENTRALISED
SERVICES AND OVERALL ADMINISTRATION. THE LEAGUE PUBLISHES A REVIEWING JOURNAL
JOINTLY WITH THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION, A QUARTERLY INFORMATION SHEET ON
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN BAVARIA, BOOK LISTS AND A HANDBOOK FOR THE USE OF THE
STAFF, MAINLY VOLUNTEERS, FOR WHOM SHORT TRAINING COURSES ARE PROVIDED. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS MAINTAINED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE 1968 THE LEAGUE HAS
COMPILED ANNUAL STATISTICS BY ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING; THE PROGRAMME IS
ALSO USED EVERY 3 YEARS FOR THE COMPILATION OF STATISTICS ON ALL CHURCH
LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY.
