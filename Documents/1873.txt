THE DUALITY OF CLASSIFICATION' TAXONOMY AND MERONOMY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. IN THE
CONTEXT OF NATURAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT, CLASSIFICATION IS
VIEWED AS THE GROUPING OF OBJECTS IN CLASSES (TAXONS) AND AS THE FINDING OF
COMMON STRUCTURES (ARCHETYPES) WITHIN THE OBJECTS. AN ARCHETYPE IS A STRUCTURE
OF PARTS (MERONS). THE CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS AN
INTERACTIVE PROCESS WHEREBY THE GROUPING BY TAXONS ALTERNATES WITH THE
IDENTIFICATION OF TAXON ARCHETYPES, WHICH ARE USED AGAIN TO UPDATE THE TAXON
COMPOSITION. PRESENTS A MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE TAXONOMIC GROUPING OF OBJECTS AND THEIR PARTITIONING INTO MERONS, WITH
SPECIAL MENTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION.
