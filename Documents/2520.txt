THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM ON RESEARCH IN
DOCUMENTATION (ISORID).
     
A READING OF THE AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
ON RESEARCH IN DOCUMENTATION (ISORID), A JOINT UNESCO-FID OPERATION, REVEALS
THAT THE SYSTEM HAS MET AS YET UNRESOLVED STRESSES THAT HINDER THE EFFECTIVE
CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS EXPECTED TO MAKE. A
QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON WITH THE US-BASED 2LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES
TODAY1 (LIST) IS NOT KIND TO ISORID AND REFLECTS THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY THAT
ISORID HAS WITH ITS ESSENTIALLY COOPERATIVE BASIS FOR GATHERING DATA. THE
THEORETICAL BASIS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL REGISTER APPEARS SOUND, BUT
PRACTICALITIES ARE HINDERING ITS EFFECTIVENESS TO THE FIELDS OF DOCUMENTATION,
INFORMATION SCIENCE, AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
