STRENGTHEN THE WORKERS' INFLUENCE.
     
THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS (KOMMUNALE
BIBLIOTEKARBEIDERES FORENING) HAS REGULARLY PUBLISHED ITS PERIODICAL
2KONTAKTEN, 1HAS DEVELOPED LIAISON WITH THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES (NKF), REPORTS SATISFACTORY BRANCH ACTIVITY, AND HAS OVER 600
MEMBERS. IT HAS HOWEVER NO REAL INFLUENCE ON LIBRARY POLICY. FURTHER ADVANCES
DEPEND ON INCREASED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. IT IS AN
ESSENTIAL LINK BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
BETTER-ORGANISED COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARY BODIES IS IMPORTANT. THE
INFLUENCE OF LIBRARY WORKERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED IN MAJOR FIELDS CONCERNING
LIBRARY POLICY, SUCH AS THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL, LIBRARY EDUCATION, AND
COMPUTERISATION. THE INCOMING COMMITTEE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MEMBERS WITH TRADE
UNION EXPERIENCE AND AN INTEREST IN LIBRARY POLICY.
