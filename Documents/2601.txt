WE SHALL NEED TO PESTER THE POLITICIANS.
     
SUMMARISES THE TALKS ON VARIOUS FORMS OF HANDICAP GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON THE
READING HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES ARRANGED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
J. PETERSEN: 'THE READING HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES IN THE FUTURE': HIGHER
PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO MATERIALS FOR THIS GROUP. S. HOLST: 'SERVICES TO
THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED': THIS IS THE MOST NEGLECTED GROUP; THE POLICY OF
COMMUNITY CARE NOW POSES AN INCREASING CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. S.
JENSEN: 'THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED': THESE ARE MAINLY THE ELDERLY. G.S.
NIELSEN: 'THE MOBILITY HANDICAPPED': THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNABLE TO READ,
BUT THEY DEPEND LARGELY ON DOMESTIC LENDING SERVICES AND SERVICES LIKE SPOKEN
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. L. AAGAARD: 'THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING'. J.O. RIIS: 'THE
APHASICS': THESE OFTEN HAVE DEFECTIVE VISION, SO THAT READING MATERIAL MUST BE
CLEAR AND SIMPLE. J. KYNDBORG: 'DYSLEXICS'. B. PORS: 'TECHNICAL AIDS':
DESCRIBES AN EXHIBITION. A DANISH I NSTITUTE OF TECHNICAL AIDS HAS NOW BEEN
ESTABLISHED.
