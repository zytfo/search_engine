THE BEST BOOKS FOR THE LIBRARIES. THE SEARCH FOR RESERVES IS VITAL.

300 REPLIES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE ON ACQUISITIONING IN BIBLIOTEKAR' (MOSCOW) (1)
1981 WERE RECEIVED: 200 FROM MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, 100 FROM RURAL ONES. 54% OF
LIBRARIES MENTIONED LIBRARY SUPPLIERS' UNSATISFACTORY MANAGEMENT OF
ALLOCATIONS; 90% MENTIONED POOR FULFILLMENT OF ORDERS. LIBRARY SUPPLIERS'
GREATEST DEFICIENCIES WERE IN SUPPLYING FICTION AND CHILDREN'S LITERATURE,
FOLLOWED BY HISTORY, TECHNOLOGY, ART, AGRICULTURE, MEDICINE, NATURAL HISTORY,
POPULAR SCIENCE, SPORT, LITERATURE, ETHICS AND LAW, EDUCATION, DOMESTIC
SCIENCE. LIBRARIES IN NEW TOWNS HAVE ACUTE ACQUISITIONING PROBLEMS. SCHOOL
LIBRARIES SHOULD ACQUISITION CENTRALLY THROUGH LIBRARY SUPPLIERS.
CORRESPONDENTS SUGGESTED MORE BOOKS OUGHT TO BE SENT TO THE LIBRARY NETWORK.
BOOK-DISTRIBUTION MUST BE STRICTLY CONTROLLED, PAYMENT OF BOOKSELLERS' WORK
BEING DEPENDENT ON SATISFACTORY FULFILLMENT OF LIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS PLANS.
