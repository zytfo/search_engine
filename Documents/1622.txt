A TEST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LITERATURE HISTORY OF FOUR HISTORICAL
ACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM.
     
EXAMINES 4 HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM IN PHYSICS.
THE PURPOSE IS TO DESCRIBE THE LITERATURE USED BY THE HISTORIES QUANTITATIVELY
USING FREQUENCY OF DATA OF PUBLICATION. ADDITIONALLY, 1 OF THE HISTORIES WAS
TESTED AGAINST THE OTHER 3 TO DETERMINE DIFFERENCES. A MOMENTS TEST AND A T
TEST WERE EMPLOYED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE LITERATURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS,
WHEN PLOTTED AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION DATE IS NON-NORMAL,
NEGATIVELY SKEWED, AND IS PLATYKURTIC. THE TEST FOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONE
HISTORY AND THE CUMULATIVE HISTORIES WAS NON-SIGNIFICANT. INTERPRETATIONS OF
THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED.
