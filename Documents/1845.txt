FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.
     
IN 1979 IN THE USA, OVER 10 BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45 BILLION CAMERAS,
BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,
SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FOR
POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO
PERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLY
NOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAINING
OF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.
IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFUL
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TO
CARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT. PRESENTS A LIST OF USEFUL AND RECENT SOURCE
MATERIALS ON PHOTO-CONSERVATION. IF PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE RAISED ENOUGH
TO SEEK AND FOLLOW THE ADVICE GIVEN BY PROFESSIONALS, MUCH OF THE USA'S
PHOTOGRAPHIC HERITAGE CAN BE S AVED.
