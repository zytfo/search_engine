AMALGAMATIONS AND LIBRARIES.
     
IN 1982, 30 AUSTRALIAN COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, PRINCIPALLY
TEACHER-TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, WILL BE AMALGAMATING. THIS STUDY, UNDERTAKEN
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE VICTORIAN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,
CONSIDERS THE PROBLEMS LIKELY TO FACE THE LIBRARIES OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS
BECAUSE OF AMALGAMATION AND MULTI-SITE OPERATION. THE AUTHOR VISITED UK
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN OCT 81 AND PRODUCED GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND
LIBRARIANS OF AUSTRALIAN COLLEGES DERIVED FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL POLYTECHNIC
EXPERIENCE OF SUCH PROBLEMS.
