NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS AS A FIELD OF STUDY-THE STATE OF THE ART.

THE AUTHOR RECENTLY COMPILED AN INVENTORY OF NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS
FOUND IN 4 MAJOR JERUSALEM COLLECTIONS. WHILE PREPARING THIS 1ST LISTING OF
145 TITLES, HE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, WHICH HE SHARES WITH LIBRARIANS.
FIRSTLY, THERE WERE OFTEN DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOLDINGS LISTED IN THE
CATALOGUE AND ACTUAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH ONLY A FIRST-HAND CHECK OF EACH ISSUE
COULD RECTIFY. MOREOVER, THE CATALOGUE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOURCE FOR
CHANGES OF EDITORS, MANAGERS-OR EVEN SUBTITLES AND OTHER TITLES (OFTEN
APPEARING IN OTHER LANGUAGES). THE CENTRAL ZIONIST ARCHIVES POSED A SPECIAL
PROBLEM' NEWSPAPERS AS A RULE ARE TRANSFERRED TO ITS LIBRARY COLLECTION, BUT
SOME ISSUES OF SHORT-LIVED ZIONIST PERIODICALS WERE APPENDED TO CORRESPONDENCE
AND REMAIN IN THE ARCHIVAL COLLECTION, WITHOUT BEING LISTED IN THE LIBRARY
CATALOGUE.
