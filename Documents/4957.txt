BOOK PRESENTATION. AN ENQUIRY INTO FRENCH SCHOOLCHILDREN'S PREFERENCES IN
LAYOUT AND TYPOGRAPHY.
     
DESCRIBES A PROJECT TO DETERMINE CHILDREN'S ATTITUDES TO THE PHYSICAL
QUALITIES OF BOOKS. OVER 200 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY CHILDREN AFTER
EXAMINING 75 BOOKS OF ALL TYPES. USING THIS AS A BASIS, A SERIES OF GROUP
DISCUSSIONS WAS CONDUCTED TO GIVE A MORE DETAILED PICTURE. THE RESULTS,
RELATING TO BOTH LITERARY AND INTELLECTUAL CONTENT, AND PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTICS, ARE PRESENTED GRAPHICALLY. IT WAS FOUND THAT CHOICE WAS
INFLUENCED MORE BY AESTHETIC THAN BY LITERARY CONSIDERATIONS. AS A FOLLOW UP,
A PROJECT WAS DEVISED ENABLING GROUPS OF CHILDREN TO COMPOSE PAGES OF TEXT
THEMSELVES. AN AUDIO-VISUAL PRESENTATION ON BOOK PRODUCTION FOR SCHOOL
AUDIENCES USING INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THIS SURVEY IS PLANNED.
