PUBLIC RELATIONS IN THE 1980S.

A DISCOURSE ON LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC RELATIONS.
NO LIBRARY CAN ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IF IT IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ITS PUBLIC
FUNCTIONS, AND A VARIED PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME, ENTHUSIASTICALLY PRESENTED
CAN DO MUCH TO GAIN TOTAL SUPPORT FOR, AND WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN, THE
LIBRARY. IN THE FUTURE PUBLIC RELATIONS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT
FUNCTION, MORE COST-ORIENTED, BETTER PUBLICISED, SLICKER AND MORE
PROFESSIONAL, AND THERE WILL BE BETTER EDUCATION FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS.
DISCUSSES WHAT THE LIBRARIAN CAN DO TO INVOLVE HIM/HERSELF MORE IN THE PUBLIC
RELATIONS PROGRAMME.
