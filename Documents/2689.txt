BEFORE A NEW LIBRARY LAW' THE SERVICE LEVEL MUST BE PRESERVED, BUT THE RATE OF
INCREASE LOWERED.
     
INTERVIEW WITH LASSE BUDTZ, CHAIRMAN OF THE DANISH FOLKETING'S CULTURAL
COMMITTEE AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY SPOKESMAN ON LIBRARY AFFAIRS. THE
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW LIBRARY LAW WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE SESSION 1981-82, AND IT IS HOPED TO GET BROAD PARTY SUPPORT
FOR IT. THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS, NOT A JOINT DIRECTORATE, BUT LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR TASKS COMMON TO PUBLIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SERVICES. WOULD PREFER SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO
BELONG UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY, BUT THEY SHOULD CATER FOR LEISURE READING
AS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE LEFT
TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATION OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN BOOK SELECTION, AND LOCAL
POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT EXERCISE ANY FORM OF CENSORSHIP PRIOR TO SELECTION.
STANDS FIRM ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY LIBRARY SERVICES. LIBRAR IES
CANNOT BE IMMUNE FROM CUTS AND THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR WAS AN ATTEMPT TO RETAIN
THE LEVEL OF SERVICES WHILE LOWERING THE RATE OF INCREASE.
