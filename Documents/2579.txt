ALL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE FOR ALL.
     
ARGUES THAT DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NO LONGER FOLLOW THE DEMOCRATIC
TRADITION OF ANGLO-SAXON LIBRARIES, NOR DO THEY RESPOND TO THE NEW SIGNALS
COMING FROM THE UK AND THE USA, WHERE THE SOCIAL IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES AND
THE NEED FOR COORDINATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES ARE STRESSED AND WHERE IT IS
FELT THAT LIBRARIES AS ARSENALS OF KNOWLEDGE HAVE THE SOLUTION TO MAN'S GLOBAL
PROBLEMS. IN SWEDEN TOO THERE IS A TENDENCY TOWARDS A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM.
INSISTS THAT ALL LIBRARY TYPES SHOULD BE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED UNDER 1
MINISTRY; THE SEPARATIST ATTITUDE OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS THEREFORE
REGRETTABLE. LIBRARIES SHOULD DEFINE THEIR USERS MORE BROADLY, NOW THAT THE
EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE POPULATION HAS RISEN AND USERS NEED MATERIAL AT ALL
LEVELS. ECONOMIC CUTS NECESSITATE A UNIFIED SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES.
USE OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN LIBRARIES IS A QUESTION OF THE
SURVIVAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBRARY, IT CAN REVOLUTIONISE RURAL LIFE AN D
EDUCATION. IT IS SOCIETY THROUGH ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH MUST DECIDE
WHETHER INFORMATION IS TO BE A PUBLIC, DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED, OR A PRIVATE
CONCERN.
