IMPROVING USER TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
THE AIM OF USER TRAINING IS TO DEVELOP THE ABILITY OF THE USER TO MAKE FULL
USE OF LIBRARY STOCK AND FACILITIES. THE USER MUST UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED IN THE PUBLIC AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES. A
GROUP CALLED LIBRARY WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE EXAMINED THE WAY IN WHICH A
BROCHURE INTRODUCING YOUNG PEOPLE TO LIBRARY USE WAS BEING USED IN PRACTICE.
MORE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN USER TRAINING THROUGH INCREASED
COOPERATION WITH TEACHERS AT TRAINING COLLEGES AND INSTRUCTORS OF APPRENTICES.
USER TRAINING SESSIONS SHOULD BE PLANNED TO INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE ACTIVELY,
TAKING THEIR SPECIAL INTERESTS INTO CONSIDERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT
LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN USER TRAINING
METHODS AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT.
