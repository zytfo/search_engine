AND REGIONAL JOURNALS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS AND SPECIALIST
SUBJECT JOURNALS. THE MAJORITY OF THE REVIEWS WERE IN GERMAN; THERE WAS LITTLE
RESPONSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPT FRANCE. THE MOST POPULAR FORMS OF REVIEW
WAS A REPORT WITH AN EVALUATION OR SHORT NOTES. THE MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUE
REVIEWS ARE OF INTEREST TO 4 MAIN GROUPS' THE AUTHOR, THE LIBRARIES
