DOCUMENTATION AND LITERARY RESEARCH.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES
PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, DISTINGUISHING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE
LITERARY RESEARCHER FROM OTHER USER NEEDS. DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE KIND OF
DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED, AND SHOWS HOW THE NOTIONS OF OBSOLESCENCE AND
EXHAUSTIVITY ARE LARGELY IRRELEVANT. TO MEET THESE SPECIFIC NEEDS, QUEBEC
SHOULD ESTABLISH A UNION CATALOGUE OF RESEARCH RESOURCES AND A NATIONAL
RESEARCH LIBRARY; HERE THE COMPUTER IS NOT THE SOLUTION.
