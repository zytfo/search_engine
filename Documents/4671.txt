THE PLACE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM IS DIVIDED INTO 2
SECTIONS-NATIONAL LIBRARIES (SERVING THE GENERAL PUBLIC) AND SPECIAL
(INCLUDING UNIVERSITY, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES). THE FUNCTION
OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY IS HELD BY THE ROYAL LIBRARY; THE COORDINATING
ROLE RESTS WITH THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE TENDENCY TOWARD
CENTRALISATION RESULTED, IN 1975, IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COUNCIL FOR
INFORMATION SERVICES WITH THE FUNCTION OF CENTRAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING OF
THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE ORGANISATIONAL ROLE IN THIS SPHERE RESTS
WITH THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
