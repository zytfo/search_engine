THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH LIBRARY AND LITERATURE
CENTRE) MEMBERS' MEETING, 11TH DECEMBER 1980' A PERSONAL IMPRESSION.

REPORT OF THE MEETING OF NBLC MEMBERS IN AMSTERDAM, 11 DEC 80. TOPICS
DISCUSSED INCLUDED CUTBACKS IN FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE NETHERLANDS, RAISING OF LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP
CHARGES, AND REDUCTION OF THE AGE-LIMIT FOR FREE LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP. ALTHOUGH
MANY OF THOSE PRESENT WERE OPPOSED TO A REDUCTION IN LIBRARY SERVICES SOME
FELT THAT THE GROWTH OF RECENT YEARS, IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, COULD LEAD TO A
REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF SERVICES. THE QUESTION OF ALLOWING THE PUBLIC A
GREATER VOICE IN THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE POSITION OF UNPAID
VOLUNTARY STAFF WERE ALSO DISCUSSED.
