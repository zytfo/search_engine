ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.
