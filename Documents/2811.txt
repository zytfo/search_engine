JOURNALS IN LIBRARIES.
     
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH JOURNAL COLLECTIONS IN
LIBRARIES. COLLECTIONS WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE, UNSUITABLY STORED AND OFTEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE OWING TO INCOMPLETE CATALOGUING. 1 IMPROVEMENT WAS THE
INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM WHICH WAS EASIER TO STORE AND MEANT THAT ORIGINAL
JOURNAL COPIES COULD BE STORED IN THE ARCHIVES AND NOT DAMAGED BY CONTINUAL
USE. THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN LIBRARIANS' COMMISSION FOR JOURNALS HAS
PUBLISHED IMPORTANT MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE BEST WAYS OF STORING AND
CATALOGUING JOURNAL COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATIVE FILMING WITH OTHER LIBRARIES.
AN IMPORTANT AID TO LOCATING JOURNALS IS GERD HAGELWEIDE'S LOCATION CATALOGUE
DEUTSCHE ZEITUNGSBESTANDE IN BIBLIOTHEKEN UND ARCHIVEN (GERMAN JOURNAL
COLLECTIONS IN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES). THE PUBLICATION OF REGIONAL JOURNAL
CATALOGUES IN WESTPHALIA, BERLIN, HESSE AND WURTEMBERG HAS HELPED TO IMPROVE
LENDING SYSTEMS IN THESE AREAS.
