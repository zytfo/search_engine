STRUCTURE GENERATION ON THE BASIS OF BCT REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A METHOD OF STRUCTURE GENERATION BASED ON BCT (BLOCK-CUTPOINT TREE)
REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE GENERATION
PROGRAM IS A PART OF THE AUTOMATIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS SYSTEM OF MASS SPECTRA
(ASASMAS) AND IS USED WHEN A SET OF THE INFERRED SUBSTRUCTURES ARE GIVEN AS
INPUT DATA. THE INPUT SUBSTRUCTURES ARE REPRESENTED BY MEANS OF BCT.
