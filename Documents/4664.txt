A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,

OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITH THE AIM OF BUILDING A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED
LIBRARY SYSTEM BASED ON UNIFIED PRINCIPLES. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE,
FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. CONCLUDES WITH A
