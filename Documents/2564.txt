FRANCE FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEW.
     
COMPARED WITH THE USA, UK AND THE SCANDINAVIAN STATES FRANCE HAS AWAKENED FROM
ITS DREAM LATE TO TRY TO DEVELOP AN UP-TO-DATE LIBRARIANSHIP. IN RECENT YEARS
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE 5-STORY CENTRE
GEORGES POMPIDOU INAUGURATED IN 1976. IT IS A COMPLEX OF MUSEUM, LIBRARY,
BOOKSHOP, RECORD SHOP, CINEMAS, THEATRE, CONCERT HALL, I.E. A KIND OF CULTURAL
CENTRE. AFTER AN ACCOUNT OF THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE, DESCRIBES THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY OF THE PARIS MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS 2 PARTS-AN OLDER AND AN
UP-TO-DATE HOLDING. OBSERVING CRITICALLY, THE LIBRARY OF THE PARIS MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY FALLS BEHIND THE MORE MECHANISED US ONES BUT THE LIBRARIES OF
HUNGARIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO TO REACH
THIS 'MODEST' LEVEL.
