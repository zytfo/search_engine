AND PHILOSOPHY WITH AN INCREASING CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE NEED OF USERS TO
UNDERSTAND LIBRARIES. CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY 20TH CENTURY
EXPERIMENTS WITH LIBRARY USER INSTRUCTION, AND REVIEWS SOME OF THE CONFLICTS
WHICH EMERGED AS STRONGER ASSERTATIONS WERE MADE IN FAVOUR OF THIS
INSTRUCTION. ARGUES THAT THERE IS A CONTINUING LACK OF SOUND PHILOSOPHICAL AND
