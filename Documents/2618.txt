LIBRARY NEEDS OF CHILDREN ATTENDING SELF-HELP MOTHER-TONGUE SCHOOLS IN LONDON.
     
124 LONDON MOTHER-TONGUE 'SATURDAY SCHOOLS' WITH 13,919 PUPILS WERE SENT
POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES; THEIR TEACHERS WERE INTERVIEWED; 200 CHILDREN WERE
QUESTIONED ON THEIR READING HABITS AND LIBRARY USE; AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
VISITED TO ASSESS THEIR SERVICES TO ETHNIC MINORITIES, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN.
124 CHILDREN READ IN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE; 121 HAD READ A BOOK IN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS; AND 170 USED PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PROBLEMS
INCLUDED LACK OF SUITABLE BOOKS, LANGUAGE EXPERTISE IN SOME LIBRARY
AUTHORITIES, AND SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY CONTACT. ALL CONCERNED WOULD BENEFIT
FROM MORE COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION.
