CHARGING FOR ONLINE RETRIEVAL SERVICES.
     
ATTEMPTS TO SET OUT THE DILEMMA MANY LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION OFFICERS FIND
THEMSELVES IN, AS TO WHETHER ON-LINE SERVICES SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE
END-USER, OR SEEN AS A CHARGE UPON THE LIBRARY. IN THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE
THE USER HAS TO PAY, VERY MANY VARIATIONS EXIST IN TERMS OF WHICH ELEMENTS OF
THE TOTAL COST ARE CHARGED BACK. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN. THE PAPER STRESSES THE
DESIRABILITY OF FORMULATING SOME RATIONAL SCHEME FOR BRINGING CHARGING
POLICIES INTO LINE, OFFERS NO SOLUTIONS, BUT INVITES COOPERATIVE DISCUSSION OF
THE SITUATION.
