MOTIVATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.

ARGUES THAT STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN THEMSELVES,
MOTIVATE STAFF. THEY ARE SEEN AS BEING CATALYTIC IN NATURE, NEEDING TO BE
UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF ADULT LEARNING AND MOTIVATION THEORY. SUGGESTS
WAYS OF BRINGING ABOUT A RENAISSANCE IN THE LIBRARY AS A WORKPLACE WHICH WOULD
BRING THE 'QUALITY OF WORK LIFE' MOVEMENT TO LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES MANAGERS'
AND NON-MANAGERS' ROLES, RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE CREATION
OF AN ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE TO GROWTH, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
