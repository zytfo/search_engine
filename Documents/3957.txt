ICI'S EXPERIENCES WITH CROSSBOW.
     
THE CROSSBOW SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN REGULAR USE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND HAS PROVED
AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF HANDLING CHEMICAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION
IN VERY LARGE FILES. AT ICI IT IS USED WITH AN INTEGRATED CHEMICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL DATA BASE AS WELL AS ON EXTERNAL WLN-BASED FILES. SOME SALIENT
FEATURES OF CROSSBOW ARE BRIEFLY ASSESSED.
