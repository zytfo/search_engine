FACULTY STATUS FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION' A REVIEW AND
ANALYSIS.

RESPONSES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE FROM 64 4-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE
ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION REVEAL THAT 62 OF THE SCHOOLS GRANT SOME OF THEIR
LIBRARIANS FACULTY STATUS, AND THAT 40 GRANT FACULTY STATUS TO ALL LIBRARIANS.
THE GREATEST DISCREPANCY IN BENEFITS RECEIVED BY TEACHING AND LIBRARY FACULTY
ARISES IN LENGTH OF CONTRACT YEAR AND PUBLISHING RESPONSIBILITIES. DIRECTORS
OF ONLY 12 OF THE 40 LIBRARIES NOTE CONTROVERSY OVER FACULTY STATUS FOR
LIBRARIANS, YET COMMENTS ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE RESULTS THEMSELVES
SUGGEST OTHERWISE. ALSO, RESPONDENTS' UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES
AND BENEFITS INDICATES A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT FACULTY STATUS SHOULD MEAN
TO AND FOR THEM.
