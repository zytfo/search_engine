THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S TASK OF FORMING A SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THE COMPETENCE
OF THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING BODIES OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
     
THE FREIE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN (BERLIN UNIVERSITY) IN WEST BERLIN WAS TAKEN AS
AN EXAMPLE FOR ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S
TASK OF FORMING A LIBRARY SYSTEM. SUCCESS IN THIS TASK DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE LIBRARY BUT IS AFFECTED BY THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE
COMPETENT UNIVERSITY BODIES. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO
COORDINATE, SUPERVISE AND ADVISE THE DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO CARRY
OUT THIS TASK THE SYSTEM PLANNING DEPARTMENT MUST BE COMPLETELY INTEGRATED
INTO THE UNIVERSITY INTERNAL INFORMATION STREAM, IT MUST BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE
INITIATIVES INTO THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES OF THE UNIVERSITY
AND FOLLOW THESE UP. THIS INTERDEPENDENT WORK WAS STUDIED IN DETAIL AT THE
BERLIN UNIVERSITY. WEAK POINTS IN THE SYSTEM WERE ANALYSED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR
REDUCING PREJUD ICIAL EFFECTS WERE MADE. THIS STUDY SHOULD GIVE RISE TO
INTERNAL DISCUSSION AT THE UNIVERSITY CONCERNED AND MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST TO
OTHER EXTERNAL LIBRARIES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE.
