THE ARABIAN GULF PLANS ITS LIBRARY FUTURE.

HIGHLIGHTS THE NECESSITY OF FORGING NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ARAB WORLD
AND THE WEST. THE ARABIAN GULF HAS GREAT FINANCIAL RESOURCES, HAS BECOME
FAMILIAR WITH WESTERN ACHIEVEMENTS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE, AND DESIRES TO ESTABLISH COMPARABLE SERVICES IN THE ARABIC
LANGUAGE. THIS REQUIRES NEW INITIATIVES AND THE ALLOCATION OF GREATER PRIORITY
TO THE PUBLICATION OF BOOKS IN ARABIC.
