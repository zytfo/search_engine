THE CONTENT AND ORGANISATION OF RESEARCH (EARLY RESULTS FROM THE FIRST 10
YEARS).
     
SOVIET LIBRARIES HAVE SEEN A 25% INCREASE IN USAGE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.
THIS EXPANSION HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH
INTO LIBRARIANSHIP. RESOURCES HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED ON THE STUDY OF SOME OF
THE VERY REAL PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY GROWTH (THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF LIBRARIES,
WAYS OF IMPROVING BOTH IDEOLOGICAL AND INFORMATION WORK, ORGANISING LIBRARY
SYSTEMS ON THE BASES OF CENTRALISATION AND COOPERATION), THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
AND PLACES INVOLVED IN RESEARCH HAS INCREASED AND THE SYSTEM OF DIRECTING
RESEARCH HAS CHANGED WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF STATE CONTROL AND THE
COORDINATION OF LONGTERM PLANNING.
