THE FUTURE OF CATALOGERS AND CATALOGING.

THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF US
RESEARCH LIBRARIES. REDUCED BUDGETS, LESS EMPHASIS ON PERFECTION, GREATER USE
OF LIBRARY ASSISTANTS, STANDARDISATION, AND AUTOMATION HAVE HAD A PROFOUND
EFFECT UPON THE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CATALOGUERS. IF CURRENT TRENDS
CONTINUE, FUTURE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON THE SHARING OF HIGH QUALITY BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS THROUGH A NATIONAL NETWORK. AS THE AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING
DECREASES, THE CATALOGUER OF THE FUTURE WILL MORE LIKELY BE A MANAGER WITH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LIBRARY'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL SYSTEM. ONLY IN LARGER
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING
REMAIN. ANOTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIO WILL BE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CATALOGUERS AS
PUBLIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES STAFF MERGE INTO INTEGRATED SUBJECT UNITS.
