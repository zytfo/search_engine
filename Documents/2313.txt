IMPORTANCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OVER INFORMATION (IN ARABIC).
     
ORGANISATION AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION HAVE BECOME DIFFICULT AS A RESULT OF
KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION AND THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES OF PUBLICATION. THE MAIN
PROBLEM IS THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OVER LIBRARY MATERIALS WHICH CAN BE
SOLVED BY BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORKS BASED ON THE SUBJECT AND QUALITATIVE PRINCIPLES.
THE USE OF AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL MUST BE CONSIDERED.
