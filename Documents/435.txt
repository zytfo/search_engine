CONCEPTUAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

IF WE WANT TO BUILD INTELLIGENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, WE WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEM
THE CAPABILITIES OF UNDERSTANDING NATURAL LANGUAGE, AUTOMATICALLY ORGANISING
AND REORGANISING THEIR MEMORIES, AND USING INTELLIGENT HEURISTICS FOR
SEARCHING THEIR MEMORIES. THESE SYSTEMS WILL HAVE TO ANALYSE AND UNDERSTAND
BOTH NEW TEXT AND NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES. IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, THEY WILL
HAVE TO DIRECT MEMORY SEARCH TO REASONABLE PLACES.
