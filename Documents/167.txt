CURRENT PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA-EXPERIENCES AND APPROACHES
TO PROBLEMS.

A LIBRARY COMMISSION ON THE REFORM OF DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION
PRESENTED ITS REPORT IN 1979, PROPOSING A LIBRARY ACT COVERING BOTH PUBLIC AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES, WITH A JOINT LIBRARY DIRECTORATE. ALL LIBRARY STOCKS SHOULD
BE AVAILABLE THROUGH AN INTER-LIBRARY LOAN CENTRE. THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY,
AT PRESENT PRODUCED IN SECTIONS, SHOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE. THE FREE
LENDING PRINCIPLE IS MAINTAINED. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AFTER A 5-YEAR TRANSITIONAL
PERIOD, SHOULD BE WHOLLY FINANCED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITHIN 2 YEARS.
MUSIC LIBRARIES SHOULD BE OBLIGATORY. PROPOSED CHANGES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES
EMPHASISE A NEED FOR COORDINATION. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES WOULD
BE TRANSFERRED TO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM UNDER A RECENT ACT, IN AN ATTEMPT TO
UNIFY THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE OBLIGED TO
ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER LIBRARIES SUITABLE FOR THEIR NEEDS.
