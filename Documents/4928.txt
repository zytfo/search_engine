REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEMS PLANNING FOR THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE.
     
POSTAL SERVICE STUDIES OF AN ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEM AND OF ELECTRONIC
COMPUTER-ORIGINATED MAIL ARE REVIEWED. AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW IT IS
CONCLUDED THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC MAIL
SERVICES INSOFAR AS THEY ENHANCE PRESENT PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF MESSAGES.
ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICES SHOULD BE MANAGED BY AN INDEPENDENT UNIT WITHIN THE
POSTAL SERVICE, AND CONTINUED MARKET RESEARCH WILL BE NEEDED TO DETERMINE
CUSTOMER NEEDS. PLANNING FOR THE NEW SERVICES SHOULD BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP
WITH LABOUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC MAIL AGAINST
INSPECTION AND DISCLOSURE MUST BE ASSURED.
