PROFICIENCY IN READING AS A CRITERION FOR A GENERAL TYPOLOGY OF READERS.
     
SOME KIND OF CLASSIFICATION OF READERS IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMPLEX EDUCATION
OF LIBRARY USERS. MUCH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IMPOSED TOO RIGID DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN READERS OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. A MORE RELEVANT DIVISION WOULD BE
ACCORDING TO PROFICIENCY IN DIFFERENT READING SKILLS' CHOOSING BOOKS TO READ;
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS READ; ACQUIRING AND USING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED. 6
READERSHIP GROUPS DIVIDED BY THESE CRITERIA ARE PROPOSED, RANGING FROM USERS
WITH NONE OF THESE SKILLS TO THOSE WITH A HARMONIOUSLY DEVELOPED RANGE OF
SKILLS.
