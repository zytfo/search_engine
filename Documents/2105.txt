A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL BASIS FOR CLASSIFYING READERS.
     
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP READING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE ABLE
TO CATEGORISE HIS READERS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL METHOD,
CONSIDERING BOTH THE ACTUAL READING ABILITY AND MOTIVES OF THE READER.
'READING ABILITY' SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF' DIRECTION IN READING
(PURPOSIVENESS); ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS; AND ABILITY TO ABSORB CONCEPTUAL
CONTENT. READERS' MOTIVES ARE DIVIDED INTO' THOSE WHOSE READING IS DIRECTED
TOWARDS DEVELOPING THEIR SOCIAL AND MORAL OUTLOOK; THOSE WHO NEED HELP IN
CHOOSING A CAREER; THOSE WHO READ TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONALITY; BUT FURTHER
SUB-DIVISIONS MAY ALSO BE WORKED OUT.
