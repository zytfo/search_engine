SOME PROBLEMS WITH PART-TIME COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
IN ADDITION TO FULLTIME COURSES OFFERED BY THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN
SOFIA, PART-TIME COURSES, I.E. IN-SERVICE COURSES, HELP TO INCREASE THE NUMBER
OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS. FROM 1960 TO 1976, 936 PART-TIME STUDENTS ENROLLED,
AND 834, I.E. 89%, COMPLETED THEIR STUDIES INCLUDING 16 STUDENTS FROM THE
CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY. 99% OF THE STUDENTS WERE WOMEN, WHO WERE
FORCED FREQUENTLY TO EXTEND THEIR STUDIES BEYOND 3 YEARS BECAUSE OF MATERNITY
LEAVE, ILLNESS AND OTHER REASONS. IN FUTURE, THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, IN
PARTICULAR, MUST HELP TO SELECT SUITABLE CANDIDATES AS PROSPECTIVE PART-TIME
STUDENTS. LIBRARIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO INTENSIFY THEIR ASSISTANCE TO ENROLLED
PART-TIME STUDENTS, PROVIDE HELP DURING THE COURSE AS WELL AS TO ASSIST THOSE
STUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR FINAL EXAMINATIONS AND THESES. ONLY THEN CAN
PART-TIME COURSES GRADUALLY BECOME AN EQUIVALENT TO FULLTIME STUDY.
