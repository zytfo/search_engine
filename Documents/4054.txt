THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE ADVENT OF DATA PROCESSING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE HAS IMPROVED THE
STANDING OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A PROFESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME CREATED A
DEMAND FOR BETTER QUALIFICATIONS, ESPECIALLY GRADUATE ENTRY. LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PUTTING PRESSURE ON LOCAL AND
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF THEIR MEMBERS. THIS STATUS VARIES
CONSIDERABLY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL TREND IS UPWARDS,
AND FROM 1 KIND OF LIBRARY TO ANOTHER. IN SOME UNIVERSITIES, LIBRARIANS ENJOY
FULL ACADEMIC STATUS, BUT A LIBRARIAN MUST BE MORE THAN A PURE ACADEMIC AND
MUST BE PROFICIENT IN THE PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS AS WELL.
