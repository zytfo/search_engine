SHARING DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION.

DURING THE PAST 2 YEARS, THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS UNIT OF THE UNITED NATIONS
DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN RUNNING A
PILOT PROJECT TO ESTABLISH AN AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEM, DEVELOPMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND TO PROVIDE INTRADEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION OF
INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACTIVITIES. THE SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL WITH A
SAMPLE DATA BASE OF ALMOST 2,000 RECORDS. TO AVOID UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION,
FULL USE WAS MADE OF THE DEVSIS (DEVELOPMENT SCIENCES INFORMATION SYSTEM)
PRELIMINARY DESIGNS AND THE MACROTHESAURUS. THE MINISIS MINICOMPUTER SYSTEM,
DEVELOPED BY THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTRE, IS BEING TESTED
FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS. THE SYSTEM IS COMPATIBLE WITH SEVERAL OTHER UNITED
NATIONS SYSTEMS.
