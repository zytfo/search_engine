PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. INCREASINGLY, US HISTORIANS ARE CARRYING OUT RESEARCH
INTO THE ACCULTURATION OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE USA. THE ARCHIVES OF THE JEWISH
LABOUR BUND, HELD IN NEW YORK CITY ARE ONE OF THE RAREST IMMIGRANT
COLLECTIONS, EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE, THEIR COMPREHENSIVENESS, AND
THEIR FOUNDERS' INTENTION TO PRESERVE THE PRESENT FOR THE FUTURE. THE
COLLECTION, INCLUDING PAMPHLETS, NEWSPAPERS AND POSTERS WAS ESTABLISHED IN
1899 IN GENEVA, TO SERVE AS THE ARCHIVE-LIBRARY OF THE THEN ILLEGAL SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC JEWISH LABOUR BUND OF RUSSIA, POLAND AND LITHUANIA. DESCRIBES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARCHIVES, THE COLLECTION ITSELF, AND ITS VALUE TO
HISTORIANS.
