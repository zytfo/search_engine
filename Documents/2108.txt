DIRECTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNIST EDUCATION AND
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS.
     
USSR LIBRARIES HAVE REACHED A NEW STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR
EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION. THEIR AIMS NOW INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MORE LISTS OF
RECOMMENDED READING, MORE ACTIVE PROPAGANDA OF ATHEISM, GREATER EMPHASIS BOTH
ON MORAL AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION AND ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION, AND THE EFFECTIVE USE OF TELEVISION AND RADIO. A SINGLE SYSTEM FOR
PROMOTING BOOKS IS REQUIRED AND LIBRARIES SHOULD FURTHER INVESTIGATE A
DIFFERENTIATED APPROACH TO READER SERVICES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A NEW
LONG-TERM EDUCATIONAL PROJECT, BASED ON COORDINATED RESEARCH.
