THE FIRST CENSUS OF AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
DISCUSSES THE 1ST AACOBS (AUSTRALIAN ADVISORY COUNCIL ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SERVICES) TASK FORCE ON STATISTICS, 1973-81 AND PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION AND
EVALUATION IN RELATION TO THE COLLECTION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
STATISTICS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP. SHORTCOMINGS WHICH EMERGED IN THE TASK FORCE'S
NECESSARILY EXPLORATORY APPROACH ARE ACKNOWLEDGED, AND THERE IS SOME COMMENT
ABOUT THE RELATIVE VALUES OF DIFFERING MATERIALS HELD BY AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES,
AND OF DIVERGENCIES IN APPROACHES TO LIBRARY MEASUREMENT IN SOME SECTORS OF
THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY.
