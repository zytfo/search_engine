LIBRARIES AND BOTANICAL GARDENS.
     
SUGGESTS THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO 3 PARTS' THE LIVING
COLLECTION, THE DRIED COLLECTION AND THE LIBRARY. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE
STERLING MORTON LIBRARY AT THE MORTON ARBORETUM, CHICAGO AND DEPLORES THE
BREAKING UP AND SELLING OFF OF SOME MAJOR BOTANICAL GARDENS IN EUROPE AND NEW
YORK. ALSO STRESSES THAT A LIBRARY IS MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF BOOKS-IT IS A
SELECTION FOR A PURPOSE, CHOSEN WITH CARE AND SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETELY
REPLACED BY ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
