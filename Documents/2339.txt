EXCHANGE AS A TRADITIONAL METHOD OF ACQUISITION FOR NATIONAL LIBRARIES.
     
(MA DISSERTATION.) ANALYSES THE MAIN ISSUES AND CONCEPTS THAT SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED BY THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN COUNTRIES WITHOUT A TRADITION OF
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTS. DEFINES THESE
TERMS AND EXAMINES THE UNESCO SPECIAL CONVENTION ON THE SUBJECT. EXAMINES
DIFFERENT ORGANISATION PATTERNS ARISING FROM INTERCHANGE OF DUPLICATES AND
NOTES THE 2 ARRANGEMENTS BEST SUITED FOR NATIONWIDE OPERATION (THE COLLECTING
DEPOT AND THE CENTRAL BUREAU). TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION, MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEW INSTITUTO AUTONOMO BIBLIOTECA NACIONAL Y DE
SERVICIAS DE BIBLIOTECAS IN VENEZUELA (WHICH ABSORBED THE BIBLIOTECA NACIONAL
IN 1977) AND THE CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS Y
TECNOLOGICAS (CONICIT).
