STUDY OF RECREATIONAL READING IN THE FIRST GRADE MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS IN BELO
HORIZONTE, BRAZIL.

REPORT BASED ON A POSTGRADUATE THESIS, PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. THE READING HABITS OF A 5% SAMPLE OF PUPILS WERE INVESTIGATED BY
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM TEACHERS AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT READING IS NOT A POPULAR LEISURE ACTIVITY, AND
THAT NEITHER TEACHERS NOR LIBRARIANS ARE AS ACTIVE AS THEY MIGHT BE IN
STIMULATING INTEREST IN READING. THE NECESSITY FOR FURTHER MORE DETAILED
STUDIES IS EMPHASISED.
