PHARMACISTS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT, WHICH
CAN ONLY DEVELOP THROUGH USE OF A WELL-EQUIPPED, WELL-STAFFED LIBRARY. ONLY A
FEW HUNGARIAN DISTRICT AND CITY HOSPITALS MEET THESE DEMANDS. THE ONLY
SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR A CENTRE OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY NETWORK OR THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF PHARMACEUTICS TO ORGANISE PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION. SUCH AN
ORGANISATION WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON DEMAND.
