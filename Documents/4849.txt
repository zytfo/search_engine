THE FATE OF OUR GRAPHIC RECORDS DEPENDS ON.
     
DISCUSSES SOME STEPS WHICH US LIBRARIANS ARE TAKING TO TRY AND SOLVE THE
PROBLEM OF THE RAPID DETERIORATION OF GRAPHIC MATERIALS. ARGUES THAT
LIBRARIANSHIP EDUCATION DURING THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN EMPHASISING SERVICES,
ADMINISTRATION, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND NONPRINT MEDIA, AND PAID LITTLE
ATTENTION TO THE TRANSMISSION OF IDEAS, AND THE CAUSES WHICH LEAD TO THE
DISAPPEARANCE, PRESERVATION, AND REINTERPRETATION OF THESE IDEAS. URGES
LIBRARIANS TO SHARE AND VALUE A SENSE OF HISTORY, WHICH IS SEEN AS THE ONE AND
MOST IMPORTANT UNIFYING ELEMENT WHICH WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THEIR GRAPHIC
RECORDS.
