A NEW CANADIAN FEDERAL LAW ON ARCHIVES.
     
CONSIDERS THE PRESENT SITUATION RELATING TO CANADIAN ARCHIVES AND DISCUSSES
THE KIND OF LEGISLATION REQUIRED TO ENSURE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE ARCHIVE
OPERATION, PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE NEW LAW. SURVEYS BRIEFLY THE
RECENT SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AFFECTING ARCHIVES, AND SUMMARISES TO
DATE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING THE
LAW. EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS,
AND PUBLIC AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES, AND ANALYSES THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEFINING
ARCHIVAL DOCUMENTS, THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES, AND THE FUNCTIONS OF
ARCHIVES IN GENERAL. IN CONCLUSION, EMPHASISES AS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE
NEED TO SAFEGUARD GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND EQUALLY TO FACILITATE ACCESS FOR
RESEARCHERS, BY RESTRUCTURING THE ARCHIVE SYSTEM SO THAT IT CAN ADAPT TO
MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
