LIBRARIES, LIBRARIANS AND DISABLED PERSONS: HELPING OR HANDICAPPING?.
     
DISCUSSES THE EFFORTS OF LIBRARIANS TOWARD CREATING AN AWARENESS OF, AND
INITIATING A RESPONSE TO, THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF THE PRINT-HANDICAPPED. THESE
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF LIBRARIANS, WHO
THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND COMMITTEE ENDEAVOURS HAVE MANAGED TO AROUSE THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE PROFESSION AND FORCE IT INTO MEANINGFUL ACTION. THE
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED HAS EMPHASISED THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO
FIRSTLY UNDERSTAND AND SECONDLY CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE.
