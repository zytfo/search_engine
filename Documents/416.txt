PASCAL DATA BASE FILE DESCRIPTION AND INDEXING RULES IN CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY AND
MEDICINE.

THIS REPORT ON THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY PASCAL DATA BASE DESCRIBES THE FILES AND
THE INDEXING RULES FOR CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, AND MEDICINE. PASCAL DEALS WITH ALL
ASPECTS OF CHEMISTRY WITHIN 2 SUBFILES WHOSE COMBINED YEARLY GROWTH IS ABOUT
100,000 REFERENCES. INDEXING FOR CHEMISTRY USES 2 LEXICONS OF CONTROLLED TERMS
DESCRIBING PHENOMENA, PROCESSING, PROPERTIES, METHODS, EQUIPMENT, NAMES OF
CHEMICAL REACTIONS, AND SUBSTRUCTURES OR FAMILIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. A
SIMILAR SET OF 2 VOCABULARIES IS USED FOR BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. THE FORM OF
THE DESCRIPTORS AND THE INDEXING IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED THROUGHOUT PASCAL IN
THAT INDEXING IS ACCOMPLISHED TO THE MOST SPECIFIC TERM WITHIN A HIERARCHICAL
