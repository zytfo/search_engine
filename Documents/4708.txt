STALKING MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE.
     
WHEN PONTIAC HIGH SCHOOL'S MEDIA CENTRE PURCHASED A MICROCOMPUTER, THEY
ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS IN LOCATING SUITABLE PROGRAMS. A LIST OF PROGRAMS FINALLY
LOCATED IS GIVEN WITH DETAILS OF THE MANUFACTURERS AND NOTES ON USE. THE
ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN SOFTWARE PACKAGES ON APPROVAL, IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS, WAS NOT TOTALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT 28 PROGRAMS OUT OF THE
37 REQUESTED WERE AVAILABLE FOR PREVIEW. SUGGESTS THAT THE REASONS FOR
WITHOLDING APPROVAL MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEWNESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL
MARKET COUPLED WITH FEARS OF COPYRIGHT ABUSE.
