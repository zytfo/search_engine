THE IMPACT OF THE OCLC INTERLIBRARY SUBSYSTEM ON A SCIENCE ORIENTED ACADEMIC
LIBRARY.
     
ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED FOR 1 YEAR OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY'S USE OF OCLC AS A BORROWER, AS WELL AS A LENDER. THE
KNOWLEDGE OF LOCATION OF ITEMS IN A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARIES HAS MADE INTERLOAN
REQUEST COMMUNICATIONS FOR BOOKS EASIER, QUICKER, AND MORE PRECISE. REQUESTS
BY CALTECH FOR JOURNAL ARTICLES, REPORTS, ETC. ARE NOT HANDLED VIA OCLC.
REQUESTS RECEIVED FROM OTHER LIBRARIES SHOW SOME LACK OF DISCRIMINATION BY
SPECIFYING ITEMS NOT SHOWN AS AT CALTECH OR BY ASKING FOR RECENTLY PUBLISHED
BOOKS. HOWEVER, THE VOLUME OF SUCH REQUESTS IS SMALL.
