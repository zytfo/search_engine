COMMUNITY INFORMATION IN MOBILE LIBRARIES.

THE USE OF MOBILE INFORMATION VANS IN THE UK IS GROWING MAINLY IN URBAN AREAS,
ALTHOUGH IT IS IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT THE DEARTH OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE IS
MOST ACUTE. SMALL VANS OFFER CLIENTS LITTLE PRIVACY AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
FOR SOCIAL SERVICES HAS RECOMMENDED THE USE OF LARGE MULTIPURPOSE VANS SUCH AS
TRAVELLING LIBRARIES. THIS HAS POSSIBILITIES AND AN EXPERIMENTAL
LIBRARY/INFORMATION VEHICLE (A CONVERTED BUS) IS BEING TRIED IN BRADFORD.
PROBLEMS INCLUDE LACK OF SPACE, PARTICULARLY WHERE LOCAL GEOGRAPHY
NECESSITATES SMALL MOBILE LIBRARIES. IN SUCH CASES, LEAFLETS COULD BE KEPT IN
THE CAB.
