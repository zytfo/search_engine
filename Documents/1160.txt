COLLECTION SIZE AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCHES.

DESCRIBES THE LOGAN SQUARE EXPERIMENTAL BOOK BRANCH OF CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY.
THIS BRANCH LIBRARY IS AIMING TO PROVIDE A BETTER SERVICE TO EXISTING USERS
AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO 'OUTREACH' TO THE COMMUNITY. STAFF RESOURCES HAVE
DECREASED DURING THE EXPERIMENT AND THE BOOK BUDGET IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE
OF SIMILARLY-SIZED LIBRARIES. IN 1978-79 (THE EXPERIMENT'S 1ST YEAR), THE
BOOKSTOCK WAS INCREASED FROM 45,000 TO 66,500 VOLUMES (MAINLY BY ACCEPTING
DISCARDS FROM OTHER BRANCHES) AND A MAGAZINE COLLECTION WAS STARTED. AFTER
DECLINING FOR 10 YEARS, CIRCULATION INCREASED BY 19% IN 1979. IT IS TOO EARLY
TO ANALYSE THE EXPERIMENT'S RESULTS, BUT THE FUTURE LOOKS GOOD. PERHAPS THIS
IS A TRUE MEASURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
