VIDEO-A REVOLUTION FOR THE DEAF.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED. VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY HAS MEANT SOMETHING OF A REVOLUTION TO THOSE BORN DEAF, SINCE THEIR
OWN, SIGN, LANGUAGE CAN NOW BE PRESERVED ON VIDEO FILMS, AND THUS, IN A SENSE,
'PUT INTO PRINT'. DESCRIBES WORK CARRIED OUT AT THE COUNTY LIBRARY IN
VASTERAS, SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL CULTURAL COUNCIL, SWEDEN, TO PRODUCE VIDEO
FILMS FOR THE DEAF. PROJECTS SO FAR INCLUDE RECORDINGS OF IBSEN'S 'A DOLL'S
HOUSE', BOOKS, AND CINDERELLA. SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE, WHEN VCRS HAVE BECOME
STANDARD TECHNICAL AIDS FOR THE DEAF, IT SHOULD BE AS NATURAL FOR THE
LIBRARIES TO LEND VIDEOGRAMS TO THE DEAF AS IT IS FOR THEM TO LEND TALKING
BOOKS TO THE BLIND.
