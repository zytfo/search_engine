PATRON USE OF AN ONLINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM IN KNOWN ITEM SEARCHING.
     
PATRON USE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS' ON-LINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM WAS
STUDIED BY INTERVIEWING AND OBSERVING SAMPLE PATRONS AT PUBLIC TERMINALS. IT
WAS FOUND THAT 56% OF THE 'ORIGINAL KNOWN-ITEM SEARCHES' (SEARCHES IN WHICH
THE USER HAD NOT OBTAINED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE CARD CATALOGUE) WERE
SUCCESSFUL-WITH 16% FAILING AS A RESULT OF ERROR IN USE-AND THAT 86% OF THE
'LOCATION SEARCHES' (SEARCHES IN WHICH THE USER HAD OBTAINED THE CALL NUMBER
OF THE ITEM FROM THE CARD CATALOGUE AND WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOCATION) WERE
SUCCESSFUL-WITH 8% FAILING AS A RESULT OF ERROR IN USE.
