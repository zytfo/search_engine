82/573). THE PUBLISHING OF THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) IS
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE SUPPLY OF TALKING BOOKS. 1200 TITLES ANNUALLY ARE
PRODUCED FOR LOAN IN LIBRARIES, OF WHICH THE TPB ACCOUNTS FOR 900. THE
SELECTION OF BOOKS INCLUDES ALL EASY READERS AND 25% OF PRODUCTION ARE BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THE AGED FORM THE LARGEST USER GROUP. BRAILLE
BOOKS ARE NOW IN A MINORITY; THEY ARE LENT DIRECTLY TO READERS. CATALOGUES OF
THE TPB'S STOCK AND NEW ACQUISITIONS ARE BEING PREPARED USING THE BUMS DATA
BASE. SOME BOOKS FOR IMMIGRANTS ARE AVAILABLE. AS A LOAN CENTRE THE TPB IS
OBLIGED TO LEND TO DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND COLLATE INFORMATION ON LOCAL
LIBRARY STOCKS. IT AIMS TO DEVELOP THE DECENTRALISATION OF TALKING BOOK
PROVISION AND THEREFORE WISHES TO TRANSFER TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIRECT LENDING TO INDIVIDUALS AND PURCHASE OF AN ADEQUATE
STOCK FROM THE LIBRARY SERVICE.
