INCREASED FROM 17.4/4.9 PER HEAD IN 1950 TO 32.4/13.6 IN 1970, WHILE THE
PROPORTION OF FICTION PUBLISHED FELL FROM ONE-THIRD TO 10-15%. LIBRARY LOANS
INCREASED SEVENFOLD DURING 1945-70, WHILE BORROWERS INCREASED FROM 8% TO 26%
OF POPULATION. THE FIRST MOBILE LIBRARY APPEARED IN 1961; BY 1971 THERE WERE

ROYALTIES AND GRANTS. FINNISH AUTHORS ARE LESS WELL SUBSIDISED THAN NORWEGIAN,
