NON-ADMINISTRATIVE USERS OF ARCHIVES IN FRANCE.

REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT IN 1980 BY THE ASSOCIATION OF FRENCH ARCHIVISTS.
ITS 2 MAIN SECTIONS COMPRISE A GENERAL REPORT ON THE STATE AND ACTIVITIES OF
THE ASSOCIATION AS A WHOLE, AND 5 SPECIAL REPORTS FROM EACH OF THE ASSOCIATION
SECTIONS, DEALING WITH THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, THE ARCHIVES OF CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, REGIONAL ARCHIVES, MUNICIPAL ARCHIVES, AND BUSINESS
ARCHIVES. ALL 6 REPORTS ARE PRESENTED IN A STANDARD FORMAT, COVERING USER
CHARACTERISTICS, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, AND ARCHIVE SERVICES. THE OVERALL
PICTURE SHOWS AN EXPLOSIVE INCREASE IN THE USE OF ARCHIVE SEARCH ROOMS SINCE
1956, CAUSED BY INCREASING NUMBERS OF 'OCCASIONAL' USERS, WHILE THE NUMBER OF
ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS HAS DECREASED.
