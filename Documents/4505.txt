AMERICAN EDUCATION LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMIC STUDY/TRAINING DEBATE.
     
AS LATE AS 1899, NO MORE THAN 1/3 OF THE TEACHERS IN MASSACHUSETTS HAD BEEN
EXPOSED TO LIBRARY FACILITIES IN A NORMAL SCHOOL. DURING THE EARLY 20TH
CENTURY, A CHANGE TOOK PLACE WHICH AFFECTED TEACHER EDUCATION AS MUCH AS IT
DID OTHER DISCIPLINES. EDUCATION LIBRARY COLLECTIONS DEVELOPED, EDUCATION
LIBRARY SERVICES EXPANDED TO MEET A GROWING DEMAND. EDUCATION LIBRARIANS BEGAN
TO HOLD NATIONAL MEETINGS AND TO DEBATE QUESTIONS OF STANDARDS, BOTH
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE. THROUGHOUT ITS BRIEF HISTORY, EDUCATION
LIBRARIANSHIP SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BETWEEN THE PUSH FOR THE ACADEMIC
STUDY OF EDUCATION AND THE PULL FOR THE PRACTICAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS.
