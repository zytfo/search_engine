THE JOY OF CATALOGUING: ESSAYS, LETTERS, REVIEWS, AND OTHER EXPLOSIONS.

FEELINGS THAT CATALOGUING CODES ARE COMPLETELY SENSIBLE AND TRUSTWORTHY AND
ABOVE REPROACH HAVE PRODUCED FEWER, AND GENERALLY LESS CREATIVE AND AUTONOMOUS
CATALOGUERS, POORER CATALOGUE ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES, GREATER
MYSTIFICATION, MORE FRUSTRATION FOR PATRONS AND STAFF, AND AN ALARMING
PASSIVITY AMONGST CATALOGUERS AND REFERENCE LIBRARIANS ALIKE. PRESENTS PAPERS,
REVIEWS AND ESSAYS, SELECTED FOR THEIR INTELLIGIBILITY, 'FINDABILITY' AND
FAIRNESS, WHICH ATTEMPT TO REDRESS THE BALANCE.
