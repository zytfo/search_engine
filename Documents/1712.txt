PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COLLECTION, DISTRIBUTION AND
ANALYSIS OF STATISTICAL DATA.
     
STATISTICAL INFORMATION IS A VITAL NATIONAL RESOURCE, AND A MORE COMPREHENSIVE
EFFORT NEEDS TO BE MADE TO REVIEW AND CONTROL US FEDERAL STATISTICAL POLICY.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTS STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR REGULATION,
PROGRAMME OPERATION, POLICY ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION PROGRAMMES. STATISTICAL
POLICY MUST BE EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATED INTO LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND
REGULATORY ACTIONS, WITH A STATISTICAL OFFICE REMAINING SEPARATE FROM OTHER
ASPECTS OF INFORMATION POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF
COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN ITS DISSEMINATION AND USE OF
STATISTICAL DATA, AND PRIVATE FIRMS SHOULD ENGAGE IN ANY AND ALL ANALYSIS
APPROPRIATE FOR THE MARKETS BEING SERVED. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT
ENCROACH UPON ACTIVITIES WHICH PROPERLY BELONG IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
