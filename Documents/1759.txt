RATIONALISATION AND MODELLIFICATION' TWO COMPLEMENTARY IMPLICATIONS OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.
     
DEBATES ON THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES ARE USUALLY LIMITED TO 3
SUBJECTS' COMPUTERS, PRIVACY, AND JOB-KILLING. THE REALITY IS FAR MORE

RATIONALISATION OF THE LABOUR PROCESS(ES) INVOLVED; MODELLIFICATION
(PLANNING/REGULATING/CONTROLLING) OF THE PERSONS/THINGS/PROCEDURES MODELLED BY
DATA AND SOFTWARE; AND SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC AIMS SUPERSEDING THE
