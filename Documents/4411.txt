THOMAS BENNET AND THE ORIGINS OF ANALYTICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. A RECENT WORK ASSERTS THAT A STUDY BY AN 18TH CENTURY
SCHOLAR, THOMAS BENNET, RANKS WELL WITH CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL STUDIES. THE
WORK, ON THE THIRTY-NINE ARTICLES OF RELIGION, WAS PUBLISHED IN 1715, AND
CONSISTED OF 18 COPIES OF THE ARTICLES, 5 IN LATIN AND 13 IN ENGLISH. BENNET
REPRODUCED EXACTLY THE TEXT OF ONE MASTER COPY IN EACH LANGUAGE, AND THEN
RECORDED, IN FOOTNOTES ON THE SAME PAGE, EVERY VARIATION TO BE FOUND IN EVERY
OTHER COPY. DETAILS OF EVIDENCE WERE THEN ANALYSED, AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN. A
BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF BENNET, AND FURTHER DETAILS OF HIS WORK ARE GIVEN.
