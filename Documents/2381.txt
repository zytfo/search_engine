ALPHABETIZATION IN INDEXES: EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE 'LETTER BY LETTER' AND 'WORD BY
WORD' SYSTEM OF ALPHABETISATION, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL STUDIES
OF HOW STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SEQUENCE WORDS AND RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM INDEXES
WITH DIFFERENT SEQUENCES. CONCLUDES THAT STUDENTS USE A VARIETY OF METHODS
WHEN ASKED TO PUT WORDS IN ORDER FOR AN INDEX, WITH SENSE AND MEANING BEING A
PRIME CONSIDERATION. SCHOOLCHILDREN, HOWEVER, WERE FOUND TO BE LESS AMBITIOUS
IN THIS RESPECT, AND TO ORDER WORDS ALPHABETICALLY USING THE LETTER BY LETTER
METHOD. NO 1 METHOD OF SEQUENCING INDEXES WAS FOUND TO LEAD TO BETTER
RETRIEVAL THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS USED, AND IT APPEARS THAT EITHER OF THE 2
METHODS CURRENTLY USED BY INDEXERS CAN BE EMPLOYED WITHOUT CAUSING UNDUE
DIFFICULTY FOR YOUNG READERS.
