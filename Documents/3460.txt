THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE AND THE QUALITY OF WORKING LIFE.
     
IT IS COMMONLY CLAIMED THAT THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY TO THE OFFICE
REDUCES ROUTINE LABOUR AND FREES THE EMPLOYEE FOR MORE CREATIVE WORK. DISPUTES
THIS CLAIM BY EXAMINING IN DETAIL THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ON THE JOB
CONTENT AND JOB SATISFACTION OF 2 TYPES OF CLERICAL JOBS' PRODUCTION CONTROL
AND TELE-SALES. THE SOURCE OF THE DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF WORKING LIFE IN
THESE 2 AREAS IS LOCATED NOT IN THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF BUT MANAGEMENT AIMS AND
METHODS IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. SUGGESTS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF WORK
ORGANISATION.
