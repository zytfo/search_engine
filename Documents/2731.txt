JUST LIKE HOME AND CHEAPER THAN THE CAFE.
     
REPORT ON KARUP LIBRARY, WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LIBRARIAN, BIRTE
ELLERMANN. THE LIBRARY IS HOUSED IN A CONVERTED RAILWAY STATION. THE LACK OF
SPACE AND THE RETENTION OF THE OLD INNER WALLS CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTIMATE AND
FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE. 75% OF THE POPULATION USE IT, COMPARED TO 30% BEFORE
CONVERSION. THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S ROOM ON THE 1ST FLOOR IS A POPULAR MEETING
PLACE FOR THE 13-16 YEAR OLDS. B. ELLERMANN, THEN LIBRARIAN AT THE NEARBY
KARUP AIRFORCE BASE, WAS ASKED TO DRAW UP A PLAN FOR THE LIBRARY STRUCTURE IN
THE AREA. HER DECENTRALISED PLAN OF 3 INDEPENDENT LIBRARIES GAVE HER A DANISH
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION PRIZE. LOCAL CRAFTSMEN HAVE EXECUTED HER OWN INTERIOR
DESIGN. EXHIBITIONS ARE MADE LOCALLY, AND BOOKS ARE RECEIVED FROM A LOCAL
BOOKSELLER AND MADE READY IN THE LIBRARY SO THAT THEY REACH THE SHELVES WHILE
STILL TOPICAL.
