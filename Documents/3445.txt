A COMPARISON OF TWO WEIGHTING SCHEMES FOR BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
     
DESCRIBES 2 APPROACHES, TIED TOGETHER BY THEIR CONCEPTUAL BASIS IN FUZZY SET
THEORY, FOR REPRESENTING WEIGHTED BOOLEAN REQUESTS. ONE REPRESENTS DIRECTLY
THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPONENT BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS TO THE USER. THE OTHER
ESTABLISHES CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE A DOCUMENT CAN BE RETRIEVED.
BOTH MAY HAVE A PLACE IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS-THEIR RELATIVE
STRENGTHS SHOULD APPEAR THROUGH EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION.
