REDUCING BLOCK ACCESSES IN INVERTED FILES BY PARTIAL CLUSTERING.
     
THE RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION FROM AN INVERTED FILE REQUIRES ACCESS TO BOTH
INDEX AND DATA BLOCKS. HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DATA BLOCK
ACCESSES ARE PRESENTED, AND CAN BE REORGANISED CONCURRENTLY WITH NORMAL USER
ACTIVITIES. PREVIOUS WORK ON INTERRELATED RECORD CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES IS
DESCRIBED. METHODS FOR THE PARTIAL REORGANISATION OF DATA FILES ARE DESCRIBED
AND COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL SORT METHOD, USING AN ARTIFICIAL RANDOMLY
GENERATED FILE. METHODS DESCRIBED ARE SORTING IN ORDER OF THE CATENATED KEY
FORMED FROM THE ATTIBUTES, REORDERING A SET OF ADJACENT BLOCKS, AND THE LOCAL
OPTIMUM, PARTIAL SORT AND CARE METHODS FOR SELECTING THE CLUSTER; SORTING GAVE
THE BEST RESULTS, BUT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ON-LINE REORGANISATION. PARTIAL
METHODS FAVOUR AN INCREASE IN THE BUFFER SIZE, AND THE DISTANCE FUNCTION IS
MORE EFFECTIVE FOR SELECTING A CLUSTER, WHERE THE ATTRIBUTES HAVE MANY VALUES.
