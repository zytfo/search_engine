ZERO-BASE BUDGETING FOR LIBRARIES' A SECOND LOOK.
     
ZERO-BASE BUDGETING (ZBB) WAS GIVEN CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT
LITERATURE DURING THE LATTER 1970S. ZBB OFFERS MANY CONCEPTS AND BUDGETING
TECHNIQUES THAT MAY PROVE ESPECIALLY USEFUL TO LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN THE
BUDGET-TIGHT 1980S. INCLUDES A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE KEY FEATURES OF ZBB AS A
BUDGETING/PLANNING SYSTEM, A DISCUSSION OF THE APPLICATIONS OF ZBB REPORTED IN
THE LITERATURE, AND A SUMMARY OF THE SPECIAL BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS FOR
LIBRARIES THAT USE OF CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM ZBB, IF NOT ZBB ITSELF, MIGHT
PROVIDE.
