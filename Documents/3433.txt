THOUGHTS ON THE USE OF TELETEXT IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
TELETEXT (BILDSCHIRMTEXT) WAS 1ST SHOWN TO THE GERMAN PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL
POSTAL SERVICES IN 1977. A COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN TELETEXT, VIDEO TEXT AND
2-WAY CABLE TELEVISION. TELETEXT IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN LIBRARIES; THE
EQUIPMENT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY BY READERS AND INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM
IT AT ANY TIME. SINCE TELETEXT IS A TEXT MEDIUM FOR THE SPEEDY PROVISION OF
TOPICAL INFORMATION IT PRESENTS NO THREAT TO THE BOOK, A MEDIUM FOR READING.
TELETEXT IS ALSO USEFUL IN LIBRARY REQUEST AND LOAN PROCEDURES AND ITS USE CAN
BE IMPLEMENTED IN STAGES, RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF COSTS FOR WORK
PROCEDURES AND INFORMATION PROVISION. TELETEXT CONTAINS FEWER ERRORS THAN
PRINTED MATERIAL.
