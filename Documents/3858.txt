PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION IN THEATER LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
PROBLEMS IN CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING THEATRE RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. THE UNSUITABILITY OF
MAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HAS
PROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINAL
CLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',
THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVEN
THE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEY
DATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.
THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONG
THEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAY
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.
