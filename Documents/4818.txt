IN THE POET'S LAND.
     
THE MUZEI-ZAPOVEDNIK A.S. PUSHKINA (A.S. PUSHKIN MUSEUM-PRESERVE) IS A
LITERARY MECCA IN JUNE ON PUSHKIN'S NAME-DAY. POEMS ARE READ AND SONGS
PERFORMED IN HIS HONOUR. LIBRARIANS SHOULD HELP READERS TO APPRECIATE
PUSHKIN'S POETRY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY COULD COMPILE A WORK ON PUSHKIN BASED
ON THE MUSEUM'S VISITORS' BOOKS, DATING FROM 1899. READERS COULD BE ENCOURAGED
TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DISCOVERED PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN LITERARY EVENINGS SHOULD
TREAT ONLY ONE OF HIS WORKS AND ADAPT TO THE AUDIENCE'S AGE GROUP. FOR THESE,
LIBRARIANS COULD STUDY VARIANTS OF HIS POEMS, THE SOCIAL LIFE AND POPULAR
CULTURE OF HIS TIME. THE PUSHKINOGORETS REGIONAL LIBRARY SHOULD BECOME A
REPOSITORY OF PUSHKIN AREA LEGENDS. THE MUSEUM STRIVES TO ENCOURAGE A LIVELY
PERCEPTION OF HISTORY.
