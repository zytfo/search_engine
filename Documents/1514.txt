USING CASE STUDY IN LIBRARY RESEARCH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES
TO THE STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. EXAMINES CASE-STUDY RESEARCH, ITS
DEVELOPMENT, AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS. THE AUTHOR HAS RECENTLY STARTED A
PROJECT WHICH USES MULTI-SITE CASE STUDIES TO EXAMINE 6TH-FORMERS' CAPACITY
FOR INDEPENDENT LIBRARY-BASED WORK. USES THIS AS A FRAMEWORK TO DISCUSS
QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THOSE CONTEMPLATING THIS SORT OF RESEARCH.
CONSIDERS 3 MAIN SOURCES OF INFORMATION (INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS, AND
OBSERVATION); THEIR INTEGRATION INTO CASE RECORDS; AND THE USE OF NARRATION,
VIGNETTE, AND ANALYSIS AS REPORTING METHODS. POINTS OUT THAT IT IS CRUCIAL TO
FIND FORMS OF PRESENTATION CONDUCIVE TO A CRITICAL REACTION FROM THE READER.
