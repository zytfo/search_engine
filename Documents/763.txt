BIBLIOGRAPHY-THAT IS VERY INTERESTING! BUT WHY HAS IT NO PLACE IN THE SCHOOL
CURRICULUM?.

THE YAROSLAVL REGIONAL CHILDREN'S LIBRARY IS SUCCESSFULLY ORGANISING
LIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHY CLASSES FOR 1ST TO 8TH FORMERS, INCLUDING A QUARTERLY
BIBLIOGRAPHY DAY, AIMING TO INTEREST SCHOOL CHILDREN IN BOOKS. BIBLIOGRAPHY
DAY INCLUDES SONGS ABOUT FAMOUS LITERARY HEROES, QUESTIONS TO ANSWER FROM
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS, ETC. PLAYING WHILE LEARNING PROVED POSSIBLE, EVEN NECESSARY.
BUT THE REGION HAS ONLY PARTIALLY ADOPTED THE SYLLABUS' 'FOUNDATIONS OF
LIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE'. IN 1979 THE GOVERNMENT PAPER ON IMPROVING
THE RSFR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERAL REPUBLIC) CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE STRESSED
THE NEED FOR STUDIES ACCORDING TO A GIVEN SYLLABUS. BUT 275 OUT OF 365 SCHOOLS
IN CHUVASHIYA AND 90% OF MOSCOW SCHOOLS AVOID THIS WORK. BIBLIOGRAPHIC
LITERACY IS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH LIBRARIES AND
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
