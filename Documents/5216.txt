LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES.

DISCUSSES HOW THE LIBRARIAN CAN SERVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A SPECIALISED
TYPE OF ORGANISATION AND CONSIDERS HOW INFORMATION IS USED IN GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, ITS IMPORTANCE AS A RESOURCE, AND WHAT INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT INVOLVES. THE LIBRARIAN ACCORDINGLY MUST ADAPT HIS SKILLS TO THE
DEMANDS OF THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT, WHERE INVOLVEMENT IN INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT AND THE ORGANISATION'S OPERATIONS REQUIRES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN
PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SUGGESTS HOW SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS
COULD SHARE INFORMATION RESOURCES THROUGH NETWORK COOPERATION, AND ILLUSTRATES
THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING ORGANISATION OPERATIONS. FINALLY EMPHASISES
THE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTING TRAINING PROGRAMMES TO RECOGNISE THE KIND OF
DEMANDS THE LIBRARIAN WILL MEET IN THIS CONTEXT.
