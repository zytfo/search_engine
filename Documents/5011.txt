THE NEED FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS IN HIGHER VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION: REPORT OF A QUESTIONNAIRE HELD BY THE HBO GROUP COMMITTEE OF THE
DUTCH ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS.

SINCE THE FORMATION IN 1976 OF THE GROUP FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION WITHIN THE NEDERLANDSE VERENIGING VAN BIBLIOTHECARISSEN,
DOCUMENTALISTEN EN LITERATUURONDERZOEKERS (DUTCH ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS,
DOCUMENTALISTS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS), GROUP MEMBERS HAVE ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS PROPOSED THAT A SCHEME OF IN-SERVICE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING FOR
LIBRARIANS BE STARTED. IN 1979 THE GROUP COMMITTEE AGREED TO THESE PROPOSALS
AND IN OCT 80 A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED TO MEMBERS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT FORM
SUCH TRAINING SHOULD TAKE. OF THE 79 RESPONDENTS MORE THAN &H EXPRESSED A WISH
FOR COURSES IN AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND LIBRARY
AUTOMATION, AND OVER 75% WERE WILLING TO PURSUE SUCH COURSES IN THEIR SPARE
TIME. THE RESULTS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE HAVE NOW BEEN PRESENTED TO THE
ASSOCIATI ON OF SCHOOLS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION IN THE NETHERLANDS
FOR CONSIDERATION.
