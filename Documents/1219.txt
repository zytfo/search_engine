RESULTS OF A STATISTICAL STUDY OF THE REFERENCES CITED IN THE SEARCH REPORTS
ESTABLISHED BY THE EPO (JANUARY 1981).

53,713 REPORTS OF OFFICIAL SEARCHES CARRIED OUT FOR THE EUROPEAN PATENT
OFFICE, THE NATIONAL PATENT OFFICES OF FRANCE, SWITZERLAND, AND THE
NETHERLANDS, AND STANDARD SEARCHES WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYSED TO DETERMINE
WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO LIMIT THE SEARCHES TO DOCUMENTS FROM A
CERTAIN COUNTRY, TO PATENT DOCUMENTS ONLY, OR TO CERTAIN TIME SPANS ONLY. IT
SEEMS THAT IN CERTAIN FIELDS (SUCH AS MECHANICS) THE SEARCH COULD DISREGARD
NON-PATENT LITERATURE, BUT ALL OTHER LIMITATIONS SEEM TO RESULT IN A LOSS OF
INFORMATION.
