THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL' CURRENT TRENDS AND PROSPECTS.

THE PRIMARY JOURNAL HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT FORMAL MEDIUM FOR THE
DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION FOR OVER 3 CENTURIES. A NUMBER OF
CRITICISMS CAN BE LEVELLED AGAINST IT VIZ. THE PUBLICATION PROCESS IS TIME
CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE WHILE JOURNAL PROLIFERATION ENSURES THE SCATTERING OF
RELATED INFORMATION. RECENT INNOVATIONS SUCH AS COMPUTER-AIDED PRODUCTION,
MICROFORM PUBLICATION AND LETTER AND SYNOPSIS JOURNALS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO
OVERCOME THESE DRAWBACKS. ALTERNATIVES TO THE TRADITIONAL JOURNAL SUCH AS THE
COMPUTER-BASED EDITORIAL PROCESSING CENTRE AND THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL HAVE
BEEN MOOTED AND ARE CONSIDERED VIABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY
THAT THEY WILL BE RESISTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.
