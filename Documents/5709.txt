CABLE LIBRARY SURVEY RESULTS.

PUBLIC SERVICE SATELLITE CONSORTIUM CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES,
IN 1980, TO STUDY THEIR DATA COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS AND SERVICES. 'CABLE
LIBRARIES' (CATVLIB) WERE IDENTIFIED AS LIBRARIES CONNECTED TO LOCAL CABLE
COMPANIES. A 2ND STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT A NATIONAL SATELLITE
CABLE LIBRARY NETWORK MIGHT ALREADY BE IN TECHNICAL EXISTENCE; HOW MANY
LIBRARIES ARE PRESENTLY CONNECTED TO COOPERATIVE CABLE COMPANIES WITH
SATELLITE HARDWARE AND EXCESS SATELLITE RECEIVER CAPACITY AND OF THAT NUMBER,
HOW MANY CABLE LIBRARIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN
SATELLITE-ASSISTED LIBRARY SERVICES AND TELECONFERENCING.
