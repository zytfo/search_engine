CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION' ONE POINT OF VIEW.

EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION IN RELATION TO' THE
HISTORICAL ASPECTS, SHOWING HOW IN GENERAL THE LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
SYSTEM AT PRESENT DEVELOPED FROM THE ORIGINAL EUROPEAN PATTERN; THE
INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS, WHERE THE NECESSITY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO FULFIL THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES DICTATES ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES, IN TURN GOVERNING LIBRARY
ORGANISATION; THE TECHNICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, OUTLINING THE ESSENTIAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF CENTRALISED, PARTIALLY DECENTRALISED, AND DECENTRALISED
SYSTEMS; AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS. THIS SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD DETERMINE
ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES.
