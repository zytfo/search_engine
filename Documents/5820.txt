COOPERATIVE LINKS MADE BY LEIPZIG MUNICIPAL MUSIC LIBRARY.

PUBLICITY WORK PLACES GREAT DEMANDS UPON A SPECIAL LIBRARY. LEIPZIG MUSIC
LIBRARY WORKS CLOSELY WITH MUSIC PUBLISHERS, SCHOOLS, YOUTH CLUBS, THE
UNIVERSITY AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMPOSERS AND MUSICOLOGISTS AND IS
DEVELOPING LINKS WITH THE LOCAL THEATRE AND MUSIC SCHOOLS. THIS RESULTS IN
COOPERATIVE ORGANISATION AND FINANCE FOR MUSICAL ACTIVITIES, JUSTIFIED BECAUSE
OF THE VALUE OF LIVE PERFORMANCES AND THE USE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY MATERIAL. THERE IS GOOD PUBLICITY FOR THE MUSIC LIBRARY'S STOCK OF
140,000 ITEMS INCLUDING SOME VALUABLE 1ST EDITIONS. AGREEMENTS WITH COMPOSERS
AND PUBLISHERS RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON NEW PUBLICATIONS AND
1ST PERFORMANCES AND IN A RATIONAL USE OF MONEY. PUBLICATION EXCHANGES ARE
ESPECIALLY USEFUL. THROUGH COOPERATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY, MUSIC
LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING CAN BE PROVIDED FOR STAFF.
