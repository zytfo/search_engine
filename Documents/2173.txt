HOW CAN LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS BE MEASURED?.
     
EXAMINES THE LIBRARY LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARY
EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THIS
METHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWING
IMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. A
MANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976 BY
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTE
MATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTS
FOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978)
USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTER
MEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.
IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVENESS IS A COMPOSITE CONCEPT ITS
MEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGER
NECESSARY.
