CITATION RATES TO TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PATENTS.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF
CITATIONS RECEIVED BY ISSUED US PATENTS FROM SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED US PATENTS IS
HIGHER FOR PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAN FOR A
GROUP OF RANDOMLY SELECTED PATENTS. ANALYSIS OF EXAMINERS' CITATIONS TO 100
SELECTED PATENTS SHOWED THAT THESE SELECTED PATENTS, WHICH UNDERLAY
TECHNICALLY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS, WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS FREQUENTLY CITED AS A
RANDOMLY SELECTED SET OF 102 CONTROL PATENTS. THIS FINDING PROVIDES STRONG
EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATENT CITATION DATA CAN BE USED IN
TECHNOLOGICAL INDICATORS DEVELOPMENT, AND IN TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS,
SINCE IT IMPLIES THAT THE LOCATION AND ANALYSIS OF GROUPS OF HIGHLY CITED
PATENTS CAN PROVIDE A VALID INDICATOR OF PATENT AREAS OF TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE.
