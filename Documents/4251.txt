THE GOOD INFORMATION GUIDE.
     
DESCRIBES THE MANCHESTER FAMILY WELFARE ASSOCIATION APPROACH TO THE
ORGANISATION AND EXPLOITATION OF ITS INFORMATION RESOURCES RELATING TO
HANDICAP. THE INFORMATION SERVICE IS RUN BY A SOCIAL WORKER WHO DEALS WITH
REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND IS OFTEN ABLE TO PROBE MORE DEEPLY INTO NEEDS
EXPRESSED IN AN APPARENTLY SIMPLE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION
FILES ARE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL AND GROWING SUBSTANTIALLY WITH INPUT FROM FWA
AND LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL WORKERS.
