INFORMATION AND LITERATURE DEMAND.

BETWEEN 1970 AND 78 THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL LITERATURE ORDERS RECEIVED FROM
OUTSIDE BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE IN COLOGNE INCREASED BY NEARLY 400%
TO 210,000. SINCE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICES EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY
DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIBRARY NEEDED DETAILED INFORMATION ON REQUESTED
MATERIAL FOR FUTURE PLANNING, SO IN 1978 A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE
HELP OF THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION).
INFORMATION FROM 12 LIBRARIES WAS OBTAINED ON THE SOURCES OF ORDERED
LITERATURE, THE USE OF MATERIAL BY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS, THE USE OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTS, THE TYPES AND LANGUAGE OF
MATERIAL REQUIRED AND THE TYPE OF LIBRARY MAKING THE REQUEST. THE SURVEY'S
CENTRAL FINDING WAS THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
SERVICES CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCED USER DEMAND. LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR THIS
AND THEIR FINANCING BODIES MUST SUPPORT THEM.
