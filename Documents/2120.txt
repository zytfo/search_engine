COLLECTING CANADIANA AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO HOW MANY CANADIAN BOOKS REACH
THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND THEIR ROUTE. THE CANADIAN COLLECTION IS NOT
CATALOGUED SEPARATELY AND THE LAST STUDY OF CANADIAN HOLDINGS WAS CARRIED OUT
IN 1971. LC HOLDINGS REFLECT READER INTEREST (AND REQUESTS FROM OTHER
LIBRARIES), SO IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT THE RECENT INCREASE IN CANADIAN STUDIES
COURSES AT US UNIVERSITIES WILL AFFECT LC ACQUISITION POLICIES (AT PRESENT A
MATTER OF RANDOM SELECTION AND INTERMITTENT FUNDING).
