THE CASE OF THE MISSING SUBTITLE.
     
WITH REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT PASSAGES IN AACR2 AND ISBD(G), NOTES THE
ELIMINATION OF THE TERM 'SUBTITLE' AND THE RESULTANT DIFFICULTIES. SUBTITLES
WILL NOT DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER CALLED BY THAT NAME. THE
TERM MUST BE REINSTATED IN THE OFFICIAL VOCABULARY OF CATALOGUING AND
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF 'TITLE PROPER' AND 'SUBTITLE' FORMULATED. SUCH
ACTION WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES,
LEAVING MUCH LESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CATALOGUES AND
RESULTING IN GREATER ENTRY STANDARDISATION.
