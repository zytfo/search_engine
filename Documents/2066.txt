MOBILE LIBRARY IN JORDAN (IN ARABIC).
     
IN JORDAN, THE 1ST MOBILE LIBRARY WAS FOUND IN HEBRON BY THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION IN 1956. IN 1970 THERE WERE ABOUT 15 MOBILE LIBRARIES BUT THIS
NUMBER GRADUALLY DECREASED AND NOW THERE ARE ONLY 3; IN IRBID, ZARKA AND HAYA
CULTURAL CENTRE IN AMMAN. THE PROBLEMS OF THE MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE ARE
CAUSED BY THE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY MATERIALS.
