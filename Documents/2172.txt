THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEW
POLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.
     
IN 1979 NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC
('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHIN
WEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCE
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOME
MORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOW
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THE
ALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME AN
INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.
HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRAL
POLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITION
CAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LI
BRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.
