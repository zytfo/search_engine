CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THE
PLR SCHEMES OPERATING IN DENMARK, NORWAY, SWEDEN, FINLAND, ICELAND, THE
NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY. ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A JOINT PLR SCHEME IN
SCANDINAVIA, OR AT LEAST RECIPROCAL BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, HAVE BEEN
UNSUCCESSFUL. DENMARK, THE NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY ARE FACING THE
PROBLEM OF MAINTAINING DIFFERENT SCHEMES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC
COMMUNITY (EEC). OF THESE 3, ONLY WEST GERMANY HAS A PLR SCHEME WHICH IS
WITHIN ITS COPYRIGHT LAWS AND WHICH DOES NOT OPERATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS
OWN CITIZENS. THE EEC PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY; THE
EFFECT OF THIS ON PLR IS BEING DEBATED.
