USING QUALITATIVE METHODS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO
THE STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF ONE QUALITATIVE
APPROACH-ETHNOGRAPHY. ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER DERIVES FROM ITS UNDERLYING
METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES-A CONCERN WITH THE DISCOVERY, GENERATION, AND
DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS TESTING, OF THEORY; A COMMITMENT TO LEARNING THE
CULTURE OF THOSE BEING STUDIED; AND A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF
CONTEXT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, OUTLINES SOME ETHNOGRAPHICAL
TECHNIQUES-GROUNDED THEORISING (THEORETICAL SAMPLING AND THE CONSTANT
COMPARATIVE METHOD) AND TESTING THEORY (TRIANGULATION AND ANALYTIC INDUCTION).
STRESSES THAT THIS IS A RESEARCH TRADITION STILL IN THE THROES OF DEVELOPMENT.
