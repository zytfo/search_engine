A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 2. EVALUATIONS.

THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR
SIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMED
CONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED END
USERS. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL USAGES SHOWED THAT USERS WERE
ABLE TO MASTER INTERFACE OPERATION SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO FIND RELEVANT DOCUMENT
REFERENCES. SUCCESS WAS ATTRIBUTED, IN PART, TO A SIMPLE COMMAND LANGUAGE,
ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEM
APPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPE
STUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COST
EFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILY
AVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCED
INTERFACES BASED ON IMPROVED INSTRUCTION AND AUTOMATED SEARCH STRATEGY
TECHNIQUES COULD FURTHER ENHANCE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS FOR A WIDE CLASS OF
USERS. FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PRECEDING ABSTRACT.
