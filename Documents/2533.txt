MEASUREMENT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE' OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE METRICAL SPACE.
     
IT IS ARGUED THAT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH PHYSICAL,
OBJECTIVE, OR DOCUMENT SPACE FROM PERSPECTIVE, SUBJECTIVE, OR INFORMATION
SPACE. THESE 2 SPACES ARE LIKE MAPS AND LANDSCAPES' EACH IS A SYSTEMATIC
DISTORTION OF THE OTHER. HOWEVER, TRANSFORMATIONS CAN BE EASILY MADE ONCE THE
2 SPACES ARE DISTINGUISHED.
