A VIEW FROM BANGLADESH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND
SUPPORT OF LITERACY, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, AND OF INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMY
GENERALLY. INTERLENDING TAKES PLACE IN BANGLADESH BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS OF
LIBRARIES BUT PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF A STRONG NATIONAL LIBRARY TO
GIVE LEADERSHIP IN SHARED ACQUISITION AND INTERLENDING POLICIES. ANOTHER
PROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY COME UNDER DIFFERENT
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, WITH NO COORDINATION AGENCY. PROGRESS WILL DEPEND ON
SYSTEMATIC COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES.
