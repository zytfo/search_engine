LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE JOURNAL TITLE DATA ELEMENT IN DATABASES.

THE PROBLEM OF DATA ELEMENT REPRESENTATION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MOST
PERCEIVE. THE NUMBER OF STANDARDS (INTERNAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) IS
LARGE, BUT THE USE OF STANDARDS IN DATA BASES IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE RESULT IS
A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF STANDARDISATION BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS DATA BASES. THE
RESULT BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ON A PARTICULAR
DATA ELEMENT IN MULTIPLE DATA BASES. THE JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENT WAS STUDIED IN
8 DATA BASES, AND 4 MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF
STANDARDISATION WITHIN A DATA BASE AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEARCHING.
