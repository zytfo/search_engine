BE READILY AVAILABLE; THAT OVERDUE AND MISSING ISSUES BE AUTOMATICALLY SPOTTED
AND REPORTED ON; THAT AD-HOC ENQUIRIES CAN BE QUICKLY ANSWERED BY ACCESSING
THE DATA BASE AND GENERATING ONE-OFF REPORTS; THAT IT REPLACES KARDEX AND
OTHER MANUAL SYSTEMS; THAT IT IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CAN BE MAINTAINED BY
LIBRARY STAFF; THAT IT IS EASY TO USE; AND THAT IT REMAINS FLEXIBLE.
