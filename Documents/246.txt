THE ROLE OF SPECIALIZED INFORMATION SERVICES IN DEVELOPMENT.

SPECIALISED INFORMATION CENTRES CLOSELY LINKED TO RESEARCH CENTRES OF
EXCELLENCE IN A GIVEN FIELD SEEM TO BE THE MOST VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE
INFORMATION EXPLOSION AS FAR AS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED. THEY
PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED INFORMATION, CAN REACH USERS RAPIDLY, AND ENABLE THEIR
TARGET SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO BEHAVE AS A HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CASSAVA
INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE CENTRO INTERNACIONAL DE AGRICULTURA TROPICAL, CALI,
COLOMBIA, PROVIDES CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION. INFORMATION IS SELECTED, ANALYSED
FOR RELIABILITY AND EQUALITY, AND FUSED INTO PUBLICATIONS SUCH AS MONOGRAPHS,
STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEWS, AND DIRECTORIES. IT ALSO PROVIDES AN ABSTRACTING
SERVICE. EMPHASIS IS ON SATISFYING USER NEEDS RATHER THAN ON THE TECHNIQUES
FOR DOING SO.
