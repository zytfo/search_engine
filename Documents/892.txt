PRESTEL: GATEWAY TO AN ELECTRONIC EXPLOSION.

THE INITIAL UK VIEWDATA CONCEPT WAS OF A SYSTEM OF POWERFUL COMPUTERS, EACH
HOLDING ALL THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY 'INFORMATION PROVIDERS'. THE WEST
GERMANS ENHANCED THIS CONCEPT BY CONNECTING THEIR CENTRAL BILDSCHIRMTEXT
(VIEWDATA) COMPUTERS TO 'THIRD PARTY' (I.E. OTHER PEOPLE'S) DATA BASES. THE
DRAMATIC RESULTS HAVE MADE THE UK ADD THE GERMAN MODIFICATIONS TO PRESTEL AND
THE NEW SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LONDON IN EARLY 1982. DESCRIBES THE
DEMONSTRATION OF THIS 'GATEWAY' CONCEPT AT 2 RECENT UK CONFERENCES, THE
RESPONSE, IMPLICATIONS, POSSIBLE FURTHER USES OF GATEWAYS, AND THE GREATER USE
OF VIEWDATA IN WEST GERMANY THAN IN THE UK.
