PRICE INCREASES IN NATURAL SCIENCE PERIODICALS DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INTO PRICE CHANGES DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS FOR 157
CURRENT NATURAL SCIENCE PERIODICALS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ULM. WHILE IN
THE PERIOD 1976-80 AN AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE OF 5% WAS RECORDED, AFTER
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THE INCREASE RATE FOR 1981 SEEMS TO BE MUCH HIGHER
COMPARED WITH 1980; THE AVERAGE RISE FOR 85 PERIODICALS APPEARS TO BE ABOUT
21%. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO LITERATURE DOCUMENTATION SERVICES WHICH ARE
RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE TO PRINT. FROM 11 INFORMATION SERVICES INVESTIGATED THE
PRICE INCREASE DURING 1976-80 WAS ABOUT 8.2% PER YEAR; THEIR PRICE RISE FOR
1981 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AS 13.2%. THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE RISES FOR
LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED.
