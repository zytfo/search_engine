DYSLEXIA.
     
EXPLAINS THE MEANING OF THIS SPECIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE ABILITY TO READ IN ITS
VARIED FORMS, ITS POSSIBLE CAUSES AND HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN SUFFERING
FROM THIS SORT OF DISORDER, AND HOW TO HELP THEM TO SECURE NORMAL EDUCATION.
LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELECT APPROPRIATE READING FOR THEM, E.G. SHORT
STORIES WITH A SIMPLE TEXT, BOOKS WITH WELL DEFINED PRINT, ILLUSTRATIONS ETC.,
AND MAKE THE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THAT OVERCOMING THEIR DIFFICULTIES IS NOT AN
ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF BUT THAT THERE IS A WORTHWHILE STORY ONCE THE
DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN MASTERED.
