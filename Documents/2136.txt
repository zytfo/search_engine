MICROFICHE AS A VEHICLE FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS.
     
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE IS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF
IMPROVING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAMME
BY MAKING A LARGER PART OF THE DISSEMINATION IN MICROFICHE INSTEAD OF PAPER
COPY. THEY COMMISSIONED THIS STUDY ON AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT TO HELP THEM
DECIDE WHETHER MICROFICHE DISSEMINATION WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT. THE
REPORT CONCLUDES THAT, AS PRESENTLY USED, MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROFICHE
ACCRUE TO THE PRODUCER, AND MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGES TO THE USER. THERE IS
LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE TO BROADENING THE USE OF FICHE FOR THE
INTENDED AUDIENCE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES ARE
PRESENTED FOR LESSENING THIS PROBLEM, INCLUDING EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF
LIBRARIES, PROMOTING THE AVAILABILITY OF FICHE-TO-PAPER COPIERS, AND USING
MICROFICHE ITSELF IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FACILITATE INFORMATION TRANSFER,
RATHER THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE FEATURES O F A PAPER PUBLICATION IN
A REDUCED SIZE.
