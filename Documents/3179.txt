THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN ENGLAND' INCREASING DEMAND FOR SELF-FINANCING OF
SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.
     
EXAMINES THE STATE OF LIBRARIES IN THE UK. DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ESPECIALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CUTS RESULTING IN FEWER
ACQUISITIONS, CLOSURE OF BRANCHES, REDUCED OPENING HOURS AND FREEZING OF STAFF
POSTS. AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASED
FINES AND SALE OF DISCARDED MATERIAL AND PAMPHLETS, ALTHOUGH LENDING FEES HAVE
NOT YET BEEN IMPOSED. INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES IS SEEN BY MANY
AS A MEANS OF REDUCING STAFF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC,
ESPECIALLY COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN, NEVER
VERY GOOD COMPARED TO DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HAS BEEN STRUCK PARTICULARLY
HARD BY THE CUTS. THE REACTION AGAINST THE CUTS HAS BEEN LED BY NALGO IN THE
FORM OF WORK STOPPAGES AND BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS PROTESTS TO THE
AUTHORITIES.
