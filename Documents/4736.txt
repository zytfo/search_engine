SCHOOL LIBRARY STAFF ON A SCHOOL TRIP.
     
2 LIBRARY STAFF MEMBERS ACCOMPANIED A CLASS OF 14-YEAR OLDS AND THEIR TEACHERS
FROM A KASSEL COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL ON A HOLIDAY TRIP TO SYLT. THE LIBRARY
STAFF TOOK WITH THEM ABOUT 140 BOOKS ON GAMES, MODELLING, THE IDENTIFICATION
OF SEA CREATURES AND SOME CHILDREN'S FICTION. EVERY EVENING THE CHILDREN AND
TEACHERS USED THESE BOOKS AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE DAY'S ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT
THE LIBRARY STAFF DEVELOPED CLOSE CONTACT WITH SOME TEACHERS AND PUPILS WHO
HAD HITHERTO BEEN SEEN ONLY RARELY IN THE LIBRARY. SOME OF THESE CHILDREN WHO
HAD TENDED TO MISBEHAVE IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY WERE SHOWN TO BETTER ADVANTAGE
IN THE HOLIDAY SITUATION. STORY SESSIONS WERE ALSO ORGANISED AND WERE RECEIVED
ENTHUSIASTICALLY, EVEN BY CHILDREN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY SHOWN LITTLE INTEREST IN
LITERATURE.
