LIBRARIES IN PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD BECOME COMMUNITY LIBRARIES.

IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION NOW IS BEING EDUCATED, AND
COMMUNITY INFORMATION CENTRES, SUCH AS LIBRARIES, ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE
INFORMATION WHICH PEOPLE REQUIRE TO KEEP UP WITH DAY-TO-DAY EVENTS. SUCH A
CENTRE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO HELP PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR DAILY
LIFE. SINCE THE COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH LIBRARIES, MORE USE SHOULD BE
MADE OF EXISTING LIBRARIES, AND MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S LIBRARIES ARE IN
PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS, WHICH COULD FEASIBLY EXTEND THEIR SERVICES TO THE
GENERAL PUBLIC. CITES ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT,
CONCLUDING THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE
EFFICIENT LIBRARY SERVICES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
