MODE OF REFERENCE AND ITS ROLE IN SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCES.
     
CONCEIVES A MODE OF REFERENCE AS A GENERALISATION OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS USED BY LINGUISTS AND LOGICIANS IN DESCRIBING RELATIONS BETWEEN
LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS AND NON-LINGUISTIC REALITY (SUCH AS TERM, PREDICATE,
REFERENTIALITY). PROPOSES A CALCULUS FOR THE MODE OF REFERENCE OF A RUSSIAN
NOUN PHRASE, BASED ON THE SET OF FEATURES OF A NOUN PHRASE WHICH EXHAUSTIVELY
CHARACTERISE ITS MODE OF REFERENCE. EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF THE MODE ON THE
PHRASE'S SYNTACTIC AND ANAPHORIC PROPERTIES AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF
INDICATING THE MODE OF A NOUN PHRASE IN SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCES.
