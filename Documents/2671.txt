THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY AND THE ORGANISATION
OF THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH LESS THAN 30,000 INHABITANTS MAY
ORGANISE THEIR OWN LIBRARY SERVICE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE REQUIRED BY THE DUTCH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT TO WORK IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE COUNTY LIBRARY
NETWORK. LIBRARY COMMITTEES IN THESE AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE
CROSS-SECTION OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMITTEE
MEMBERS WITH LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE INSISTS ON FOLLOWING
ITS OWN POLICIES, THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM MAY BE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING A
COORDINATED POLICY FOR ALL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ITS REGION. THE INTERESTS OF
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN BE SERVED BY THE CREATION OF LIBRARY USERS' COMMITTEES
IN EACH AREA.
