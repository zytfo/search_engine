DEWEY' THE NEGLECTED INTRODUCTION.
     
DEWEY'S INTRODUCTION HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM THE CURRENT 19TH EDITION OF THE
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGEDLY PHONETIC SPELLING IT
HAS BEEN NEGLECTED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS INTRODUCTION
SAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT IS
CONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATE
THE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTS
WITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USED
CLASSIFICATION REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO RECLASSIFY ANY
ESTABLISHED LIBRARY AND THE LACK OF ANY NEW THINKING IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT LATER SCHEMES REPRESENT ANY WORTHWHILE ADVANCE ON
DEWEY.
