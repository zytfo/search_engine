CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. DISCUSSES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION (BI) MOVEMENT IN US LIBRARIES,

EMANATES FROM CONTINUING EDUCATION. REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALA
RELATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC PROGRAMMES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INSTRUCTION CONCEPT. CONSIDERS SOME REASONS FOR THE RESISTANCE OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS TO ADDING COURSES THAT WOULD TRAIN PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS FOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT RECOGNITION OF THE NEED
FOR FORMAL TRAINING FOR THE TEACHING LIBRARIAN OR THE TEACHER OF BIBLIOGRAPHY
WILL STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING.
