WHAT ABOUT THE NON-USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY?.
     
THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF
THE USER 2VERSUS1 THE NON-USER OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS CONSIDERED. THE
IMPLICATION IS THAT THE LIBRARY CAN BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF IT APPLIES ITS
RESOURCES TOWARDS MEETING THE CULTURAL NEEDS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. SOUTH
AFRICA IN THE MAIN LACKS RESEARCH ON COMMUNITY NEEDS RELEVANT TO LIBRARY
SERVICES. RESEARCH ON THE NON-USER IN THE UK, THE USA AND SOUTH AFRICA IS
BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE LIBRARY SHOULD MEET CULTURAL NEEDS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF
THE USER AND NOT OF THE LIBRARIAN. THIS MAKES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY THE MOST
COMPLEX OF ALL LIBRARY TYPES BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSE USER TYPES. AN EXAMPLE IS
GIVEN OF HOW THE CAPE TOWN CITY LIBRARIES CHANGED ITS POLICY IN SELECTING
CHILDREN'S BOOKS TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDS MORE ADEQUATELY.
