AACR2 AND THEIR EFFECT UPON ISRAELI LIBRARIES (IN HEBREW).
     
A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF AACR2 OPENS THE ARTICLE. THE RULES ARE THE RESULT OF A
DESIRE FOR TRUE INTERNATIONAL UNIFORMITY, THOUGH THEY ARE STILL
'ANGLO-AMERICAN' IN THEIR PREFERENCE OF ENGLISH FORMS. AACR2 GIVES EQUAL
STATUS TO BOOK AND NON-BOOK MATERIALS. THERE IS MUCH LESS STRESS ON
'AUTHORSHIP' AND MORE ON 'RESPONSIBILITY'. THE UNIFORM STRUCTURE OF ALL
CHAPTERS IS DESCRIBED. DESCRIBES IMPORTANT CHANGES-AS COMPARED TO AACR1-IN
RULES FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING AND HEADINGS. SOME RESERVATIONS ARE MADE
ABOUT HEADINGS FOR JEWISH RELIGIOUS WORKS. THE DECISION BY LC TO CARRY OUT
'DESUPERIMPOSITION' AND TO CLOSE ITS CATALOGUE IS NOTED, AND ITS EFFECT ON US
LIBRARIES DISCUSSED. ISRAELI CATALOGUING HAS TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWED US
PRACTICE, AND ISRAELI LIBRARIES WILL ADOPT AACR2 SOONER OR LATER TO AVAIL
THEMSELVES OF FOREIGN CATALOGUING AND TO ENABLE ISRAELI CATALOGUING TO BECOME
PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. Y ET, IT IS NOT
IMPERATIVE TO ADOPT AACR2 IMMEDIATELY. IT IS DESIRABLE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW US
LIBRARIES ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO THE CHANGES AND TO SEE HOW LC IMPLEMENTS AND
INTERPRETS THE RULES. MEANWHILE IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ALL OPTIONS IN AACR2 BE
CHECKED, AND A UNIFORM ISRAELI PRACTICE BE ADOPTED. IT IS ALSO DESIRABLE THAT
THE FEASIBILITY OF ADOPTING AACR2 AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION BY
2KIRYATH SEPHER1, THE ISRAEL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, BE CHECKED.
