ON-SCREEN INDEX.
     
SUMMARY OF AN ADDRESS GIVEN TO THE SOCIETY OF INDEXERS, 20 NOV 80. DISCUSSES
THE USE OF THE PRESTEL INDEX WHICH CONTAINS 170,000 PAGES OF INFORMATION
PROVIDED BY ABOUT 350 ORGANISATIONS. PRESTEL IS A 2-WAY VIEWDATA SYSTEM WHICH,
UNLIKE THE CEEFAX AND ORACLE TELETEXT SYSTEMS, ENABLES USERS TO SEND REACTIONS
AND MESSAGES TO INFORMATION PROVIDERS. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY THE METHODS USED TO
CONSTRUCT PRESTEL'S PRESENT INDEX. NOTES THE NEED FOR THE USE OF MULTIPLE
ACCESS METHODS AND HEAVY CROSS REFERENCING TO ALLOW FOR USERS' DIFFERENT
INTERNAL CLASSIFICATIONS. INDICATES SOME FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING
AUTOMATED INDEXING USING KEY WORDS, AND AUTOMATED INDEX MANAGEMENT.
