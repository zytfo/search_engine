BIBLIOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE: FROM TEXTUAL CRITICISM TO BIBLIOMETRICS.
     
A REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE IN 1975 AND
1ST PUBLISHED IN 1979, DISCUSSING 20TH CENTURY DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE WORK OF
POLLARD ONWARDS. REFERENCE IS MADE TO MAJOR PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD BY
SCHOLARS SUCH AS COLE, ZOLTOWSKI, GASKELL AND LEVEBRE. THE SEARCH FOR
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS DISTINGUISHED FROM TRUE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
RESEARCH, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHY THROUGH
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN BIBLIOMETRICS IS OUTLINED. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE
PROCEDURES OF MACROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS, AND OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MICROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CITATION INDEXES. THE
NEXT ADVANCE ENVISAGED IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITATION CHAINS WHEN A
HUMANITIES CITATION INDEX BECOMES AVAILABLE, WHICH MAY WELL HAVE MAJOR
REPERCUSSIONS ON THE HISTORY OF IDEAS.
