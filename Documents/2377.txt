HEINSIUS, KAYSER AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
NO HISTORICAL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR GERMAN LITERATURE EXISTS; INSTEAD
GREAT IMPORTANCE IS PLACED ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORKS COMPILED BY HEINSIUS
AND KAYSER IN THE 18TH CENTURY. THESE ARE WIDELY USED AS REFERENCE
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND THE VALIDITY OF THEIR ENTRIES IS RARELY QUESTIONED.
HEINSIUS AND KAYSER BASED THEIR CATALOGUES ON BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE
BOOK TRADE SUCH AS EXHIBITION CATALOGUES. THESE WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE AND DID
NOT INCLUDE REPRINTS OR NEW EDITIONS. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT
REFERENCES IN THE CATALOGUES AND A COMPLETE STUDY OF THE WORKS OF HEINSIUS AND
KAYSER IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS RELIABLE REFERENCE MATERIAL AND WHAT
IS NOT. A GUIDE TO USING THE CATALOGUES WHICH LISTED THE CHANGING
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE BOOK TRADE NOTING WHICH PUBLISHER WAS TAKEN OVER, BY WHOM
AND WHEN WOULD ALSO BE INVALUABLE IN THE WORK OF FOLLOWING UP BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
REFERENCES.
