LIBRARY EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION (IN ARABIC).

THE JORDAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS SUPPLIED JORDANIAN LIBRARIES WITH TRAINED
STAFF SINCE ITS LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES BEGAN IN 1964, AND THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION CENTRE WAS LATER ESTABLISHED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS
FIELD. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY EDUCATION IS HAMPERED BY EXCESSIVE INTEREST IN
FINANCIAL CONCERNS AND LACK OF PROPER PLANNING. CONTENDS THAT' ACADEMIC
QUALIFICATIONS AND FIELD EXPERIENCE OF INSTRUCTORS SHOULD BE STANDARDISED;
INSTITUTIONS QUALIFIED TO TEACH LIBRARIANSHIP MUST BE DEFINED; THE REAL
LIBRARY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; QUALITY MUST NOT BE
SACRIFICED TO OUTPUT OF GRADUATES; AND COORDINATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL
INSTITUTIONS AND THE JLA WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS.
