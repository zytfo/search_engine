THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON THE STAFF AND ORGANIZATION OF A MEDIUM-SIZED
ACADEMIC LIBRARY' A CASE STUDY.

A CASE STUDY EXAMINING THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF AUTOMATING OPERATIONS IN A
MEDIUM SIZED ACADEMIC LIBRARY ON BOTH THE STAFF AND THE ORGANISATION OVER A 10
YEAR PERIOD REVEALS THAT THE MAJOR IMPACT HAS BEEN THE REAPPRAISAL OF
FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES AND THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT. IN REGARD TO PERSONNEL, THERE
HAS BEEN AN OVERALL SAVING IN LABOUR COSTS, AND WHILE IT HAS DECREASED
PROFESSIONAL STAFF REQUIREMENTS, IT HAS INCREASED SUPPORT STAFF POSITIONS,
MANY OF WHICH REQUIRE GREATER SKILL, EXPERIENCE, AND TRAINING. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
