ALA PERSPECTIVES FOR 1981-1982.

DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE ALA COULD EXPAND ITS SERVICES TO ENABLE MORE OF
ITS MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN ITS ACTIVITIES. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE' ORGANISING
POSTER SESSIONS AND SLIDE PRESENTATIONS AT MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES; ENLARGING
THE MEMBERSHIP OF COMMITTEES; THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONTINUING EDUCATION
CENTRE AND INFORMATION CENTRE; THE EVALUATION OF ALL SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES;
AND THE DRAWING UP OF EMPLOYMENT GUIDELINES. ALSO NOTES THE WORK BEING DONE BY
THE ALA AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED, AND THE EFFORTS IT
IS MAKING TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE SERVICES OFFERED BY LIBRARIES.
