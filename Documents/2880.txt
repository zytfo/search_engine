ABOUT PERIODICALS AND THE VARIED NATURE AND FUNCTION OF THEIR INDEXES,
INVENTORIES OR CATALOGUES.
     
AFTER CONSIDERATION OF MOLINARI'S 2THE ROMAN PERIODICAL PRESS IN THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY, 1INSTANCES CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY A SINGLE
LIBRARY AND MORE THAN ONE LIBRARY. CITES CATALOGUES OF ITALIAN AND FOREIGN
PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES AND DEALING WITH A
SPECIFIED TOPIC. CONCLUDES WITH CATALOGUES OF A CITY OR REGION. A NEED EXISTS
TO RATIONALISE THIS MULTIPLICITY OF SOURCES. THE STATE AND THE CENTRAL
INSTITUTE FOR THE UNION CATALOGUE IN ROME SHOULD PRODUCE A LOCALISED GENERAL
INDEX OF ITALIAN AND FOREIGN PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY THE GREATEST NUMBER OF
ITALIAN LIBRARIES. COORDINATION ON A NATIONAL SCALE SHOULD FOLLOW. PERIODICALS
SHOULD BE TREATED AS ARCHIVES TO PRESERVE ITALIAN POLITICAL, CIVIL, ECONOMIC
AND SPIRITUAL HISTORY.
