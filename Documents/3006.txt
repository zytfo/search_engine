WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE CULTURAL LIFE MUST GROW.
     
INTERVIEWS INGAR BECKMAN-HIRSCHFELDT, CHAIRMAN OF THE SWEDISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIANS' UNION (SFF) IN CONNECTION WITH A CAMPAIGN ORGANISED BY DIK
(DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION, CULTURE), AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION OF 8
ASSOCIATIONS, OF WHICH SFF IS A MEMBER. THE CAMPAIGN AIMS TO PUT PRESSURE ON
POLITICIANS UP TO THE TIME OF LOCAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1982 AND
DEMONSTRATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CUTS; A DISCUSSION BOOK DESCRIBING THE PRESENT
STATE OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND STATING ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD GIVE
HIGHER PRIORITY TO CULTURE IS TO BE PUBLISHED. PUBLIC OPINION IS TO BE
MOBILISED AND A CULTURAL PROGRAMME FOR DIK DRAWN UP. ALTHOUGH NO SECTION OF
THE CAMPAIGN IS AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT LIBRARIES, DEMAND FOR A LIBRARY LAW TO
ENSURE REASONABLE AND UNIFORM STANDARDS WILL BE MADE. CUTS IN CULTURAL
SERVICES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO DIK AND LIBRARIANS ARE URGED NOT TO COOPERATE IN
SUGGESTING CUTS IN SERVICES AND MANPOWER. SFF EXPECTS LITTLE FROM THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY COMMISSION, ON WHICH IT IS NOT REPRESENTED.
