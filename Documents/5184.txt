THE USE OF PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING FOR THE COMPUTERISED PRODUCTION OF
INFORMATION MEDIA.

THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF PROCESSING TEXTUAL AND OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION, FOR
PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING THROUGH THE USE OF ESER COMPUTERS; VARIOUS
METHODS FOR USING THESE TECHNIQUES, BASED ON THE COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE
RANGE OF THE EQUIPMENT, ARE DESCRIBED. FIRSTLY, A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF
TYPESETTING IS DESCRIBED TO ILLUSTRATE THE TECHNICAL PROCESSES AND THE
TYPOGRAPHICALLY NEW QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN PHOTOCOPYING AND
FILMSETTING EQUIPMENT. THE ESER SETTING PROGRAMME, DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY THE
DATA PROCESSING CENTRE IN BERLIN AND OTHER INTERESTED BODIES INVOLVED IN
PRINTING AND GRAPHICS, REPRESENTS AN EXCELLENT TEXT PROCESSING PROGRAMME
SYSTEM WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE USERS. THE MODULAR CONCEPT ALLOWS
THE RATIONAL USE OF PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING FOR PRODUCTION OF A WIDE
RANGE OF INFORMATION MEDIA WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED AT LOW EXPENSE.
