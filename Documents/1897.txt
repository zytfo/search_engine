ONLINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF
GERMANY-A PROGRESS REPORT.
     
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME FOR THE PROMOTION OF INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION WAS PASSED ON 17 DEC 74. THE AIM OF THE PROGRAMME WAS TO
COORDINATE AND IMPROVE ACTIVITIES IN THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SECTOR
WHICH HAD DEVELOPED RAPIDLY IN RECENT YEARS. THE PROGRAMME CONCENTRATED ON
SETTING UP 4 SUBJECT ORIENTED DATA SYSTEMS' PATENTS, RESEARCH PROCEDURE,
ENVIRONMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL RULES. THE PROGRESS IN EACH AREA HAS BEEN
DIFFERENT. 17 LIBRARIES RECEIVED AN ON-LINE CONNECTION TO THE DIMDI (DEUTSCHE
INSITUT FUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION) DATA BANK IN COLOGNE
IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A PROJECT ORGANISED BY THE MINISTRY FOR RESEARCH AND
TECHNOLOGY. LIBRARIES ALSO HAD ON-LINE CONNECTIONS TO DATA BANKS FORMED BY THE
INFORMATION CENTRE FOR ENERGY, PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS. THE QUESTION OF
FINANCE IS THE LARGEST OBSTACLE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES PROVIDING PERMANENT O
N-LINE FACILITIES FOR LITERATURE RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH SOME ON-LINE DATA SERVICES
ARE AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES FREE OF CHARGE THE COST OF THE HARDWARE HAS TO BE
COVERED BY THE LIBRARIES.
