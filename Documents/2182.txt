IMPROVING THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE.
     
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP. THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF THIS GUIDANCE CAN BE TRACED
BACK TO THE 1920S. TODAY IT HAS REACHED A HIGHER LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY IN ACTING
THROUGH THE CENTRALISED LIBRARY NETWORKS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE USSR. THE WAYS
IN WHICH THE LIBRARY SERVING AS THE GUIDANCE CENTRE WITHIN A NETWORK CAN
INFLUENCE THE WORK OF ITS DEPENDENT LIBRARIES CAN BE CLEARLY DEFINED, AND
ILLUSTRATED IN TABULAR FORM, BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR MORE COOPERATION
AND BETTER TRAINING FOR STAFF WORKING IN THESE CENTRES.
