PUBLIC WELFARE CASE RECORDS' A STUDY OF ARCHIVAL PRACTICES.
     
THE US FEDERAL-STATE WELFARE SYSTEM, ESTABLISHED BY THE 1935 SOCIAL SECURITY
ACT, HAS GENERATED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL CASE FILES ON WELFARE
APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS, WHICH ARE OF GREAT HISTORICAL VALUE. IN 1978 A
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO ALL STATE ARCHIVISTS TO IDENTIFY CURRENT PRACTICES
AND PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED REGARDING THE ACCESSIONING OF PUBLIC
WELFARE CASE RECORDS. THE STUDY WAS RESTRICTED TO FEDERAL-STATE CATEGORICAL
INCOME MAINTENANCE PROGRAMMES. A 92% RESPONSE RATE YIELDED DATA ON THE VALUE
OF CASE RECORDS AS RESEARCH MATERIALS, WHETHER OR NOT STATE ARCHIVES ACCESSION
PUBLIC WELFARE CASE RECORDS, PRIMARY PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE RECORDS, AND
POSSIBLE PRACTICABLE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS.
