LOTKA'S LAW AND LIBRARY LITERATURE.
     
THE APPLICABILITY OF LOTKA'S LAW TO LIBRARY SCIENCE LITERATURE WAS TESTED BY
COLLECTING AUTHORSHIP DATA FROM 2LIBRARY LITERATURE1 (1978 CUMULATED ANNUAL
VOLUME) AND BY CREDITING WORKS OF MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP TO ONLY THE FIRST-NAMED
AUTHOR. THE DATA WAS FOUND TO CONFORM TO AN INVERSE CUBE LAW MORE CLOSELY THAN
AN INVERSE SQUARE LAW (I.E. LOTKA'S LAW).
