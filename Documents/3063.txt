THE STATE CENTRAL THEATRICAL LIBRARY IN THE LIBRARY NETWORK.
     
THE STATE CENTRAL THEATRICAL LIBRARY IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LIBRARIES IN
MOSCOW AND OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES TO MANY WORKERS IN THE ARTS. ITS
SPECIALISED STOCKS, BUILT UP SINCE 1922, FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE
RESOURCES OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY NETWORK. THERE IS SCOPE, HOWEVER, FOR GREATER
COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, AND
THERE IS A NEED FOR A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO THE ORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY
BEFORE IT CAN DEVELOP TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.
