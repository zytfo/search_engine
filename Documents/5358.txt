THE TITLE PAGE OF A RECORD.

THE NEW RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) SECTION ON THE CATALOGUING OF
MUSICAL SCORES AND SOUND RECORDINGS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN PRE-PRINT FORM SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. PRACTICAL TESTING OF AND DISCUSSION ON THE SECTION
ARE ESSENTIAL TO REVEAL ANY GAPS OR AMBIGUITIES SO THAT THESE MAY BE
ELIMINATED. THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A TITLE PAGE WHERE A RECORD IS
CONCERNED MUST BE CONSIDERED. ACCORDING TO THE NEW RULES, THE LABEL ON THE 1ST
SIDE OF A RECORD OR RECORD SET SHOULD BE TREATED AS THE TITLE PAGE; IF THERE
IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION HERE THE RECORD COVER SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD.
EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN LABELS AND
COVERS.
