TRANSLATING AND ONLINE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. INFORMATION CAN BE RETRIEVED BY DIRECT INTERROGATION BY A REMOTE
COMPUTER BY MEANS OF A KEYBOARD TERMINAL AND A TELEPHONE. THE ADVANTAGES OF
SUCH AN ON-LINE SYSTEM ARE FAST ACCESS TO LARGE QUANTITIES OF DATA AND THE
OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE THE ENQUIRY BY CONVERSING WITH THE COMPUTER. AT PRESENT,
DATA BASES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF A TRANSLATION OF A DOCUMENT, OR AN
ALTERNATIVE, ALREADY EXISTS. THEY CAN ASSIST WITH TRANSLATING PARTICULAR WORDS
OR PHRASES, ESPECIALLY IN NEW SUBJECT AREAS. IN THE FUTURE, ON-LINE SYSTEMS
MAY BE EXPLOITED TO PRODUCE MORE SOPHISTICATED AIDS, REFLECTING THE STRUCTURE
OF LANGUAGE.
