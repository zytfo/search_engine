VESTMANNAEYJAR PUBLIC LIBRARY' FRAGMENTS FROM THE HISTORY OF AN ICELANDIC
PUBLIC LIBRARY.

THE VESTMANNAEYJAR PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST POVERTY, LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING, AND ULTIMATELY TO STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL. A LONG-STANDING
STRUGGLE FOR PROPER LIBRARY PREMISES HAS TAKEN PLACE; THE LIBRARY, HAVING FEW
MEANS, WAS MOVED FROM 1 TEMPORARY PLACE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT COULD BE MOVED
INTO A NEW BUILDING IN 1970. IN FEB 73 A VOLCANIC ERUPTION HIT THE HEIMAEY AND
DESTROYED THE LIBRARY, BUT THE BOOKS WERE RESCUED. IT IS THOUGHT THE LIBRARY
IS THE ONLY 1 IN THE WORLD TO BE RESCUED FROM VOLCANIC ERUPTION.
