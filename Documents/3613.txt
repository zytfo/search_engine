LIBRARY WORK WITH THE ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED.
     
BONN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE HOUSEBOUND WAS CREATED
15 YEARS AGO. IT IS ORGANISED BY THE LIBRARIAN OF A BRANCH LIBRARY
SPECIALISING IN LARGE PRINT MATERIAL AND PROGRAMMES OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE
ELDERLY. THE LIBRARIAN VISITS ALL PROSPECTIVE READERS TO FIND OUT THEIR
REQUIREMENTS; CLOSE PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS IS ESSENTIAL.
EACH OF THE 180 READERS IS VISITED ONCE IN EVERY 4 WEEKS, WHEN BOOKS ARE
ISSUED, RENEWED OR RETURNED WITHIN A SPECIALLY SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM. THE BRANCH
LIBRARY SUPPLIES ABOUT 80% OF THE STOCK AND PUBLISHES AN ANNUAL LIST OF LARGE
PRINT BOOKS HELD. THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR THESE READERS IS POOR SIGHT SO LARGE
PRINT BOOKS ARE ESSENTIAL; BOOKS SHOULD ALSO NOT BE HEAVY SINCE SOME READERS
HAVE DIFFICULTY HOLDING THEM.
