USER/INFORMATION SYSTEM INTERFACE STUDY.
     
REPORT ON A WORKING PARTY AT THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SEMINAR
IN JAN 81. FROM AN ANALYSIS OF A DOCUMENT ON USER TRAINING, THE GROUP
CONCLUDED THAT LIBRARIANS WERE DEFICIENT IN THEIR CONCEPTION OF THEIR ROLE,
AND MOVED TO CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS. THE DISCUSSIONS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT THE CURRENT TRAINING PROGRAMMES REFLECTED THE GENERAL SOCIAL
TENDENCY TO UNDERVALUE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE
FINALLY PRESENTED ON IMPROVEMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND THE INITIATION
OF FURTHER RESEARCH ON USERS. A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE WORKING PARTY IS
ATTACHED.
