STATISTICAL DETERMINATION OF BOUND VOLUME JOURNAL HOLDINGS IN A SCIENCE
LIBRARY.

DISCUSSES A METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF BOUND JOURNAL
VOLUMES IN A SCIENCE LIBRARY USING A SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THE METHOD ALLOWS THE
CALCULATION OF THE EXTENT OF JOURNAL RUNS FOR BOTH CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT
TITLES. A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOLUMES ARRIVED AT USING THE
CURRENT STUDY METHODOLOGY AND ANOTHER INDEPENDENT STUDY SHOWS AGREEMENT WITHIN
5%. FURTHER INCIDENTAL INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY
PROVIDES INFORMATION ON OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COLLECTION.
