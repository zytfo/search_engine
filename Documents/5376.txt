THE COLON IN UDC.

IN UDC A LARGE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS ARE USED TO FORM THE COMPLEX NOTATION. MOST
OF THESE SYMBOLS HAVE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE COLON, WHEN UDC IS USED IN AN AUTOMATED
INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE COLON IS CLEARLY INTENDED AS A SIGN DENOTING A
RELATIONSHIP NEEDING NO FURTHER DEFINITION BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS. THE USE OF THE
COLON WITH MORE THAN 2 UDC NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH UNOFFICIAL, HAS BECOME
WIDESPREAD; THE RANGE OF PERMITTED PERMUTATIONS IS DESCRIBED. WHERE THE COLON
MAY BE USED BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS, THE POSSIBLE REVERSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP
MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PERMUTATION IS REMOVED THEN
THE COLON RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF DENOTING A HIERARCHIC RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN 2 OR MORE UDC NUMBERS.
