PROPERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION. DELIVERY OF DEPOSITORY COPIES TO STATE
LIBRARIES IN REFERENCE TO PARAGRAPH 14 OF THE BASIC LAW (GRUNDGESETZ).
     
THE CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION AS TO WHETHER PUBLISHERS SHOULD BE LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO SUPPLY DEPOSITORY COPIES FREE OF CHARGE TO LIBRARIES IS ONCE AGAIN BEING
DISCUSSED IN WEST GERMANY. SOME PUBLISHERS IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG CHALLENGED
THIS REQUIREMENT AND TOOK THEIR CASE BEFORE THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
AN AMENDED LAW WAS PASSED IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION
WHEREBY PUBLISHERS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO SUPPLY 1 COPY FREE OF CHARGE BUT CAN
BE RECOMPENSED FOR UP TO 50% OF THEIR COSTS FOR ANY FURTHER COPIES. IN THE
LIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION DELIVERING DEPOSITORY COPIES IS TO BE SEEN AS A
SOCIAL DUTY DIRECTLY LINKED TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. THE PUBLISHER HAS A DUTY TO
THE PUBLIC TO SUPPLY LIBRARIES WITH CURRENT LITERATURE BUT A BALANCE MUST BE
STRUCK BETWEEN THIS AND THE FINANCIAL LIMITS OF THE PUBLISHER.
