APPLYING H.A. SIMON'S MODEL OF LIMITED RATIONALITY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND
COMMUNICATION.
     
A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUT
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,
POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
FOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS
(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OF
LIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL
OPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONS
FREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMAL
INFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMAL
GROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TO
FUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE
USED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THE
CONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION
SOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCE
OF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR.
