NETWORKS.

REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING ON REGIONAL LIBRARY
COOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGST
LIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THE
INCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THE
CONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900S WHEN THE NEED FOR
LIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARY
NETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.
IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICES
AND INTERLIBRARY LENDING AMONGST MEMBERS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK REQUIRES THE
MOST UP-TO-DATE TELECOMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WITHIN EACH NETWORK
A CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO ACT AS A CLEARING-HOUSE FOR THE
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.
