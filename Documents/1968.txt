THE IMPACT OF WARFARE ON THE RATE OF INVENTION' A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF
UNITED STATES ACTIVITY.
     
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO SHIFT THE FIELDS IN WHICH RESEARCH
IS CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT, MILITARY CONFLICT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CREDITED
WITH BEING THE CATALYST WHICH HAS CAUSED DECISIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. IT
IS ALSO GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT WARFARE HAS A SYSTEMATIC IMPACT ON THE
INTENSITY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY. MOST SCHOLARS HAVE CLAIMED THAT WARS INCREASE
INVENTIVENESS, ALTHOUGH A FEW ARGUE THAT CONFLICT IS A HINDERANCE TO RESEARCH.
THIS QUESTION HAS NOT RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION. USING US DATA,
A BASIC PATTERN IS REPEATEDLY OBSERVED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF A
WAR, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INVENTIVENESS, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A
MARKED SURGE. THE AVERAGE NET RESULT IS A VIRTUAL NEGATION OF THE 2 TRENDS.
