AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILIZATION METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS.

A RECENT EVALUATION OF CURRENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE USE OF LIBRARIES
CANNOT BE COMPARED; BUT, THE USE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS CAN BE COMPARED IF THE
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COLLECTIONS ARE THE SAME. THE REASONING BEHIND THIS THESIS
IS PROVIDED ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILISATION
METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS. A SET OF VARIABLES THAT ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN
COMPARATIVE STUDIES IS ALSO PROVIDED.
