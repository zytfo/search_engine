SOLVING THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARY SCIENCE ON THE
BASIS OF LENIN'S IDEAS.
     
LENIN'S WRITINGS AND STATEMENTS ABOUT LIBRARIANSHIP, TOGETHER WITH N.K.
KRUPSKAYA'S INTERPRETATION OF HIS IDEAS, FORM A BASIS FOR MODERN SOVIET
LIBRARIANSHIP. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE TODAY ARE HIS IDEAS ON RESEARCH INTO
THE CULTURAL NEEDS AND READING INTERESTS OF THE SOVIET PEOPLE, THE NECESSITY
OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INTO BOTH SCHOOLS AND WORKPLACES, THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES
IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY AND THE NEED TO PROMOTE POLITICAL
AWARENESS THROUGH PROPAGANDA AND CULTURAL AWARENESS THROUGH READING GUIDANCE.
