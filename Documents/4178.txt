HARBORING TRADITION WITH COMPUTERS, BINDINGS, AND GENEALOGICAL COLLECTIONS.
     
THE MACON/BIBB COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY, GEORGIA, IS ONE OF THE USA'S MOST
AUTOMATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT ITS SERVICES ARE BASED UPON THE TRADITIONAL
CONCEPT THAT PATRONS COME TO A LIBRARY TO SEEK GOOD BOOKS AND RELIABLE ANSWERS
TO THEIR QUESTIONS. MACON OFFERS A 15,000 VOLUME OF GENEALOGICAL WORKS-THE
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL LIBRARY'S GENEALOGICAL AND HISTORICAL ROOM. IT WAS FOUNDED
IN 1923 BY THE MARY HAMMOND WASHINGTON CHAPTER DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION. MATERIALS INCLUDE BOOKS OF ABSTRACTED WILLS, DEEDS, MARRIAGES AND
MILITARY RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL 13 STATES. THE ROOM ATTRACTS LOCAL PATRONS
AND NON-RESIDENT RESEARCHERS.
