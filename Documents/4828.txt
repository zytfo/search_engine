THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY AT ST. LOUIS, WHICH PROVIDES
AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR THE FULL RANGE OF SERIALS CONTROL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE
LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PHILSOM NETWORK. THE PHILSOM SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TO
PREDICT THE ISSUES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE VARIOUS PARTICIPATING
LIBRARIES AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH RECORDS DESCRIBING EACH OF THESE ISSUES.
THE RECORDS FOR CHECKED-IN ISSUES AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE HOLDINGS DATA, AND
INTERACT WITH PREVIOUSLY CODED DATA TO PRODUCE CLAIMS AND BINDING
NOTIFICATIONS. THE SYSTEM ALSO PRODUCES ADDITIONAL OUTPUTS TO AID IN SERIALS
CONTROL.
