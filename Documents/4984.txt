JOINT AND INDIVIDUAL AUTHORSHIP IN INFORMATION SCIENCE (INTERIM STUDY).
     
USING HIS PREVIOUS STUDIES OF JOINT AND INDIVIDUAL AUTHORSHIP IN NATURAL
SCIENCES, THE AUTHOR CARRIED OUT A SIMILAR SURVEY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE. 17
VOLUMES OF THE RUSSIAN JOURNAL NAUCH.-TEKH. INF. (1963-79) HAVE BEEN USED IN
THE SURVEY. THE CONCLUSIONS ENDORSED THE AUTHOR'S HYPOTHESIS THAT DECLINE IN
THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL AUTHORSHIP STOPS AT THE 50% MARK OF ALL PUBLISHED
ARTICLES, AND, SECONDLY, THAT FROM ALL THE FORMS OF JOINT AUTHORSHIP, THE
COOPERATION OF 2 AUTHORS IS THE MOST COMMON ONE. THE TRENDS ARE ILLUSTRATED IN
GRAPHICAL FORM.
