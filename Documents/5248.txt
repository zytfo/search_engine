BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX' 1THE USER'S PROBLEMS.A

 SUBJECT SEARCH WAS MADE IN 2BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX 1(JANUARY-JUNE 1981) FOR
INFORMATION ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS. EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF EASTERN EUROPE, THE
TEACHING OF CHILDREN FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES, THE EDUCATION OF MATURE STUDENTS,
AND REMEDIAL EDUCATION. IN EACH CASE VERY LITTLE MATERIAL WAS TRACEABLE BY
LOOKING UNDER THE MORE OBVIOUS HEADINGS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE WHEN
THE SEARCH WAS COMPLETE. ONLY A COVER-TO-COVER READING OF BEI COULD RETRIEVE
ALL THE RELEVANT ARTICLES WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY. ALTHOUGH MUCH MATERIAL
WAS IN BEI, THE USE OF PRECIS CONSTITUTED A BARRIER IN EVERY CASE AND MADE
RETRIEVAL DIFFICULT.
