THE DARC SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM A SEARCHER'S EXPERIENCE.
     
THE SEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE CHEMIST OFTEN RELATE TO A CLASS OF SUBSTANCES
(I.E. HE DESIRES INFORMATION ON ALL INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS WHICH HAVE PARTICULAR
PARTIAL STRUCTURES IN COMMON). IN DARC, AN EFFECTIVE SEARCH PROGRAMME IS
AVAILABLE WHICH ALLOWS THESE COMPOUNDS TO BE SOUGHT OUT FROM A VERY LARGE FUND
OF STRUCTURES (4.5 MILLION) AND THE STRUCTURE DIAGRAM OF EACH COMPOUND WITH
THE ASSOCIATED REGISTRY NUMBER TO BE REPRESENTED ON THE SCREEN OF A GRAPHIC
DISPLAY TERMINAL. IT IS POSSIBLE, IN ADDITION, TO USE THE RESULT OF THIS
SEARCH, IN THE FORM OF A LIST OF REGISTRY NUMBERS, AS SEARCH PARAMETERS IN A
BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, IF NECESSARY IN COMBINATION WITH NON-STRUCTURAL
INFORMATION.
