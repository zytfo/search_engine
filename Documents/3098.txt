CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MEMORIAL
PUBLIC LIBRARY, MARYLAND, 1980.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES IN THE US, NUMBERLESS REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE
WHAT KINDS OF SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CHILDREN AND WHAT LIMITATIONS
SHOULD BE PLACED ON THOSE SERVICES AND ON THE USE OF MATERIALS IN THE LIBRARY.
AS FACILITIES FOR SHARING INFORMATION HAVE GROWN, SO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT
CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SUCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AS DATA BASES AND TO
INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMMES. IN 1967, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
REVISED THE 2LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS1 TO ENSURE THAT LIBRARY USE NOT BE DENIED
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY ARE MINORS. LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON HOW THE
INTENTION OF THIS ACTION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR IGNORED. EVALUATES 1
LIBRARY'S APPROACH TO ACCESS FOR CHILDREN, EXAMINING POLICIES, REGULATIONS,
PRACTICES, AND COORDINATIONS THAT AFFECT SUCH ACCESS.
