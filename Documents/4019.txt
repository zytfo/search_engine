LEXICOGRAPHY' AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF DICTIONARIES.
     
PRESENTS A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE DICTIONARY INCORPORATING BOTH FORM AND
CONTENT BY USING A TYPOLOGY WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT EQUALLY OF THE PURPOSE AND
LINGUISTIC SCOPE OF EACH TYPE. THE STRUCTURE OF THE DICTIONARY ENTRY AND THE
PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, AND A COMPARISON MADE WITH THE
THESAURUS. FINALLY THE THESAURUS IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LANGUAGE OF
THESAURI, AS USED IN INFORMATICS TO SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBJECT AND
KEYWORD. CONCLUDES THAT THEORETICAL STUDIES ABOUT THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION
SHOULD BE BASED ON SEMANTICS.
