WORKING PAPERS IN ACADEMIC BUSINESS LIBRARIES.

A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 119 US ACADEMIC BUSINESS LIBRARIES REQUESTING
INFORMATION ON THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
WORKING PAPERS. FOR COMPARISON, A SAMPLE USER SURVEY OF BUSINESS FACULTY AND
GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANTS AT 2 LARGE MIDWEST UNIVERSITIES WAS ALSO
CONDUCTED. ALTHOUGH ONLY 33% OF LIBRARIES RESPONDING ACTIVELY COLLECT WORKING
PAPERS, THESE PAPERS ARE CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SOURCE ON CURRENT
RESEARCH BY BUSINESS FACULTIES.
