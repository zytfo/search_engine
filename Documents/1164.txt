LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING INFORMATION CONSUMER'S NEEDS.

PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS
OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND
REDUCE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED BY THE CITIZEN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO GAIN ACCESS TO
INFORMATION.
