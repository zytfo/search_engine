ART TO THE PEOPLE.
     
ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MAKING THE PUBLIC
FAMILIAR WITH ART. THE 1964 DANISH LIBRARY ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ART
DEPARTMENTS AND SEVERAL LARGER LIBRARIES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS, LENDING
MOSTLY PRINTS, POSTERS AND SLIDES. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NOW STAGNATED OWING TO
VARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. THUS ART NEED NOT BE PLACED IN SPECIAL BUILDINGS ONLY
VISITED BY HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. A LIBRARY SHOULD BEGIN BY LENDING POSTERS,
WHICH ARE EASY TO HANDLE, AND THEN PROCEED TO PRINTS. ART NEED NOT BE
EXPENSIVE, A POSTER COSTING NO MORE THAN A BOOK, AND LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT
NECESSARY. WHEREAS ACQUISITION OF POSTERS IS SIMPLE, PRINTS AND SLIDES DEMAND
MORE ATTENTION AS CENTRAL AIDS TO SELECTION OF MATERIAL ARE LACKING.
EXHIBITIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WIDENING PEOPLE'S CONCEPTION OF ART. REGRETS
THAT THE NEW DANISH LIBRARY BILL OMITS ANY MENTION OF ART.
