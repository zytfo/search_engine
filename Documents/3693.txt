LONG RANGE BUDGET PLANNING IN LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT IF A LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY MAKES A PRACTICE OF GATHERING
INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BUILD BUDGET REQUESTS, THE TIME CONSUMING DATA
GATHERING CAN BE REDUCED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BY EXAMINING THE OVERALL
REQUESTED GROWTH RATE FOR THE SYSTEM AND ADJUSTING THE FIGURES WHERE NEEDED TO
BRING IT IN LINE WITH WHAT IS FEASIBLE. THE ADJUSTED FIGURES CAN THEN BE
RETURNED TO THE REQUESTING LIBRARIANS FOR THEM TO SEE WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED AS
A REQUEST. DEMONSTRATES HOW, IN TIMES WHEN FUNDS ARE SCARCE, THIS PRACTICE
WILL ACT AS AN INFORMATIONAL AND DECISION-MAKING TOOL AND WILL SERVE TO ADJUST
LIBRARY NEEDS TO ZERO-BASE BUDGETING PRACTICES.
