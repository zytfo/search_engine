THE PUBLIC SERVICE FUNCTIONS OF SERIALS.

DISCUSSES MANY OF THE POSSIBLE RESPONSIBILITIES OF AND DECISIONS RELATING TO
THE PUBLIC USE OF SERIALS COLLECTIONS. CONSIDERS WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE
ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL OR CLASSIFICATION ORDER; FACTORS AFFECTING A DECISION
TO PROVIDE OPEN STACK COLLECTIONS THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE FOR
PUBLIC USE OR CLOSED ONES WHICH ARE SERVICED ON A PAGING SYSTEM; AND THE
REFERENCE FUNCTIONS OF SERIALS WORK. FINALLY, QUESTIONS WHETHER PERIODICALS
OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY.
