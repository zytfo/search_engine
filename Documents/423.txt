AN ASSESSMENT OF CARCINOGENICITY OF N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS BY THE SIMCA METHOD OF
PATTERN RECOGNITION.

THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE TOXIC RESPONSES OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL
POLLUTANTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES HAS MANY
ADVANTAGES. PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT SUCH
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THE SIMCA METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IS USED TO
PREDICT THE CARCINOGENICITY OF +N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS, AND THE ADVANTAGES OF
THIS METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IN SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
