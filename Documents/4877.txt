INVESTIGATION OF SEARCH CODES (MATCHCODING) FOR CATALOGUE DATA.
     
DURING THE PLANNING FOR THE INCORPORATION OF DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES, THE
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IS AIDED THROUGH THE USE OF BASIC DATA. PRESENTS AN
EVALUATION OF ABOUT 442,000 MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE ENTRIES FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ LIBRARY. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND BEHAVIOUR OF VARIOUS
SEARCH CODES (MATCHCODES) DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT DATA CATEGORIES WERE
ANALYSED CONCERNING THEIR PERFORMANCE WITHIN AN EXPANDING DATA BASE AND IN
JUXTAPOSITION WITH ONE ANOTHER. FURTHERMORE, THE FREQUENCY OF IDENTICAL DATA
AND THEIR LENGTH WAS NOTED. RESULTS SHOWED THAT CLEAR DISTINCTIONS CAN BE
ATTAINED IF TYPES OF SEARCH CODES ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC DATA GROUPS; STOP
LIST SUPPORT IS, HOWEVER, NECESSARY FOR DYNAMIC MATCHCODES.
