LEARNED SOCIETIES AND ON-DEMAND BOOK PUBLISHING.
     
A SURVEY WAS MADE OF 220 UK LEARNED SOCIETIES IN THE FIELDS OF ARTS,
HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE AIM WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY HAD EXCESS
BOOK-LENGTH MATERIAL WHICH THEY CONSIDERED WORTHY OF PUBLICATION BUT COULD NOT
AFFORD TO PUBLISH. FURTHER, THEY WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY HAD CONSIDERED THE
OPTION OF ON-DEMAND (OD) PUBLISHING AND WHAT FEATURES AN ON-DEMAND SYSTEM
SHOULD HAVE. OF 101 USABLE RESPONSES, 24 SAID THAT THEY DID HAVE SUCH AN
EXCESS, TOTALLING 160 MANUSCRIPTS. OVERALL, 38 FELT THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR
SOME CENTRALLY ORGANISED OD FACILITY. THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF SUCH A
SYSTEM WOULD BE QUALITY CONTROL, PRICE AND HARD-COPY AVAILABILITY.
