THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE READER.
     
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE EVINCE A GROWING DEMAND FOR BOOKS. BUT WHERE WILL THE PAPER
FOR MULTI-MILLION EDITIONS COME FROM? TRANSITION TO AN URBAN LIFE STYLE HAS
LED TO A GREATER DEMAND FOR BOOKS. MANY, WHO ARE NEW TO BOOK CULTURE, CONSIDER
BOOKS AS PROUD POSSESSIONS, NOT FOR USE. THE DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS BEGINNING TO
RESEMBLE THAT FOR THE MASS MEDIA. BESTSELLERS EXACERBATE LIBRARIES' PROBLEM
SITUATION. BESTSELLER TEXTS SHOULD IN FUTURE BE TRANSLATED TO ANOTHER
INFORMATION CARRIER AND BE DISSEMINATED BY LIBRARIES OR THE TRADE. HOMES AND
LIBRARIES WILL STILL NEED THOSE BOOKS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
READER.
