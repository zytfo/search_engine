BOOK SELECTION IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARY (IN ARABIC).
     
BOOK SELECTION IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES REQUIRES A METICULOUS, CONSCIOUS AND
CLEAR POLICY. CONCENTRATES ON THE SELECTION OF STORY BOOKS AND STATES THAT THE
SELECTION OF NON-FICTION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY SUBJECT SPECIALISTS. THE
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP IN TOUCH WITH CHILDREN'S INTERESTS AND
FAVOURITE READINGS.
