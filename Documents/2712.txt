MINICOMPUTERS AND AVAILABLE PACKAGES.
     
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPUTER FIELD IN RECENT YEARS ARE DESCRIBED WITH
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THE MECHANISATION OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION TASKS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINICOMPUTERS A NEW ERA
OPENED UP FOR INFORMATION WORKERS BUT A MAJOR PROBLEM HAD TO BE OVERCOME,
NAMELY THE LACK OF SUITABLE SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE THOSE FACILITIES. FOLLOWING
THE INTRODUCTION OF IBM'S STAIRS PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
ON A LARGE MAINFRAME COMPUTER, SIMILAR PROGRAMS SOON BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE
ON THE RANGE OF MINICOMPUTERS WHICH HAD STARTED TO PENETRATE THE MARKET. MANY
WERE SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION USE; DISCUSSES CAIRS
AND STATUS. A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH CAME WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WORD
PROCESSORS, PARTICULARLY THE PROGRAMMABLE SHARED LOGIC SYSTEMS. MANUFACTURERS
STARTED TO PRODUCE SPECIFIC SOFTWARE PACKAGES, INCLUDING INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL PROGRAMS, FOR THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. EXAMPLES OF RELEVANT
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND VARIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE GIVEN.
