CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE REPORTS.

THE IMPORTANCE OF US CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE REPORTS (OFFICIALLY CALLED HOUSE
AND SENATE REPORTS) IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS STEMS FROM THEIR INSEPARABLE
LINK TO CONGRESSIONAL BILLS. AS RETROSPECTIVE DOCUMENTS, THEY PRESENT A
CONCISE PRE-LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF ISSUES AND A LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF BILLS.
AS PROSPECTIVE DOCUMENTS, THEY EXPLAIN THE PURPOSES AND PROVISIONS OF INTENDED
MEASURES SO AS TO MAXIMISE POTENTIAL SUPPORT.
