A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SUBJECT APPROACHES IN C.I.J.E. AND EDUCATION INDEX WITH
REFERENCE TO THREE AREAS IN EDUCATION.

EXAMINES THE DIFFERENCES IN SUBJECT APPROACHES FOUND BETWEEN 2 SECONDARY
SERVICES IN EDUCATION: EDUCATION INDEX AND ERIC'S CURRENT INDEX TO JOURNALS IN
EDUCATION (CIJE). A SAMPLE OF 30 JOURNAL ARTICLES WAS TAKEN FROM EACH TOOL IN
THE AREAS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION, AND SPECIAL
EDUCATION; AFTER AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISPLAYS OF
THESAURAL DESCRIPTORS IN CIJE AND THE SUBJECT HEADINGS IN EDUCATION INDEX, AN
ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE TOPICS UNDER WHICH EACH ARTICLE WAS INDEXED IN BOTH
TOOLS. THE DATA ANALYSIS INCLUDES A QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE,
THE STRUCTURE OF THE 3 AREAS IN EDUCATION AS FOUND IN BOTH THE THESAURUS AND
SUBJECT HEADING LIST, TERMINOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND A GENERAL SUMMATION
OF FINDINGS. THE THESAURUS AND ITS ROLE IN THE RETRIEVAL OF MATERIALS
UTILIZING EDUCATIONAL TERMINOLOGY IS DISCUSSED  ALONG WITH PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED IN TRYING TO INDEX EDUCATIONAL TERMS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
