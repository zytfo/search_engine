SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (I).

SINCE THE 1970S THE PUBLIC HAVE MADE GREAT USE OF THE SOUND CASSETTES PROVIDED
IN LIBRARIES, WHICH HAS ENCOURAGED LIBRARIANS TO INCREASE STOCKS. LIBRARIANS
ARE USED TO COPING WITH THE RELATIVELY WELL ORGANISED BOOK MARKET, WHERE LISTS
AND REVIEWS OF NEW PUBLICATIONS ARE EASILY OBTAINED AND CRITERIA FOR
EVALUATING THEM WELL ESTABLISHED. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOUND CASSETTE MARKET
IS UNFAMILIAR TO LIBRARIANS. FEW LARGE FIRMS PRODUCE CASSETTES REGULARLY;
SMALL NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL TAPES ARE OFTEN PRODUCED, WHICH DISAPPEAR BEFORE
THEY CAN BE LISTED AND REVIEWED. THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S LIBRARY CENTRE
REVIEWS NEW TAPES TO HELP LIBRARIANS SELECT STOCKS. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING
TAPES ARE NOT YET FIRMLY ESTABLISHED; ASSESSMENT SHOULD COVER THE TECHNICAL
QUALITY OF THE RECORDING AND THE STANDARD OF THE MATERIAL RECORDED.
