NATIONAL RANKINGS AS A MEANS OF EVALUATING MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS' A
COMPARATIVE STUDY.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE REASONS
FOR THE LOW RANKINGS RECEIVED BY THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
CENTER LIBRARY IN THE PUBLICATION 2ANNUAL STATISTICS FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL
LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA1. CONCLUDES THAT THE 2ANNUAL
STATISTICS1 AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF QUALITY ARE INAPPROPRIATE AND
INACCURATE MEASURES FOR EVALUATING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, SINCE THEY ONLY MEASURE
RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND NOT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ALLOCATIONS. SUGGESTS
SOME ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION METHODS.
