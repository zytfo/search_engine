THE ENVIRONMENT FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE 1980S.
     
EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING NOW AND IN THE 1980S WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL
IMPACT ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR OPERATIONS. EFFECTIVE PLANNING DEPENDS ON
KNOWLEDGE OF LIKELY EVENTS AND TRENDS AND ON THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FACTORS
INTO THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY. THE SIGNIFICANT DEMOGRAPHIC,
POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AFFECTING LIBRARIES ARE
REVIEWED. WHILE THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUGGESTED, THEY DO NOT
APPLY UNIFORMLY TO ALL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS MUST SELECT THE FACTORS
SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR LIBRARY AND PLAN WITHIN ITS SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT.
