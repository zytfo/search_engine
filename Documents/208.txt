DID THE NEW BUILDING COME UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STAFF?.

ALL THE LIBRARY DEPARTMENTS OF THE NEW JYVASKYLA CENTRAL LIBRARY, FINLAND, ARE
AT THE SAME LEVEL. DUE TO THE OPENNESS OF THE BUILDING GUIDING IS EASIER, BUT
THIS OPEN PLAN ALSO EXAGGERATES NOISE. THE NEW BUILDING HAS BROUGHT MORE
CUSTOMERS TO THE LIBRARY BECAUSE IT IS LARGE AND MULTI-PURPOSE. ON THE WHOLE
THE STAFF IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE GENERAL DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. INCLUDES
PLANS OF THE 4 FLOORS OF THE BUILDING.
