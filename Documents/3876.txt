COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC AND GLAGOLITIC CHARACTERS'
BASIC THEORY AND METHODOLOGY.
     
THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF CYRILLIC AND
GLAGOLITIC PRINTED WORKS OF THE 15TH-17TH CENTURIES. IN 1979 THE 1ST VOLUME OF
A COMPLETE CATALOGUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE LENIN LIBRARY. THE 2DESCRIPTION OF
OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC CHARACTERS1 IS IN MANY WAYS A TRIAL EDITION. THE
METHODOLOGY USED PRESENTS A CHRONOLOGICAL CATALOGUE OF THE OLD PRINTED WORKS
WITH SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS, DETAILS OF ALL KNOWN COPIES AND THEIR
WHEREABOUTS. A 2ND TYPE OF PUBLICATION IS BEING PREPARED SIMULTANEOUSLY' THE
DESCRIPTION OF OLD CYRILLIC (EVENTUALLY ALSO GLAGOLITIC) CHARACTERS (PRINTED
WORKS) FROM PARTICULAR PRINTERS. CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THE WORK OF CATALOGUING
THE MATERIAL ARE COMING FROM LIBRARIES OF ALL THE SLAVIC NATIONS AND FROM
SCHOLARS OF THE SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
