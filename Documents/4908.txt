THIS IS WHY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS PARTICIPATING IN THE TELEDATA
EXPERIMENT.
     
EXPLAINS THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (DANMARKS
BIBLIOTEKSFORENING (DB)) IN THE DANISH TELEADMINISTRATION'S PLANNED TELEDATA
EXPERIMENT, DUE TO RUN FOR 2 YEARS FROM JAN 82. 200 TV SETS WILL BE PLACED
WITH SELECTED USERS, 25 OF WHOM WILL BE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND 10 OF THESE
LIBRARIES. ABOUT 60 ORGANISATIONS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION AND DB WILL
COORDINATE THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO THE TELEDATA BASE. DB WAS ABLE TO ARGUE
SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST FEES FOR THE USE OF THE TELEDATA DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL
PERIOD. BY BEING INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FROM
THE START, DB IS BETTER ABLE TO INFLUENCE IT. THIS ALSO EXPLAINS WHY DB IS A
MEMBER OF DANMEDIA, HAS HELPED TO SET UP A TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE AND IS
REPRESENTED IN THE MEDIA COMMISSION. A PROJECT AIMED AT EVALUATION OF THE
TELEDATA MEDIUM FROM A LIBRARY VIEWPOINT IS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE LIBRARY
INSPECTORATE AND D B. INCLUDES A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ARTICLES ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHED IN 2BOGENS VERDEN1 SINCE 1979.
