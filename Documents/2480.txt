PUBLISHING AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
     
THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, HOUSING 77 MILLION ITEMS, RECOGNISES A SPECIAL
OBLIGATION TO MAKE KNOWN WHAT IT HOLDS. THE RESULT IS A PUBLISHING PROGRAMME
OF CATALOGUES, FACSIMILES, GUIDES, RESEARCH PAPERS, LETTERS, SCHOLARLY AND
TRADE CO-PUBLICATIONS AND THE 2QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS1.
THE LIBRARY OPERATES LIKE A UNIVERSITY PRESS, PUBLISHING 30-40 TITLES PER
ANNUM, BUT IS SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS WHICH CONTROL GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING.
