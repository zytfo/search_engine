VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
SOME OF THE VISUAL TASKS INVOLVED IN USING A VDT DIFFER IN KIND FROM THOSE
ENCOUNTERED IN A TRADITIONAL OFFICE. THE SELF-LUMINOUS NATURE OF THE SCREEN
CHARACTERS AND THE 3 TASK AREAS OF SOURCE MATERIAL, KEYBOARD AND SCREEN
PRESENT A CHALLENGE TO THE LIGHTING DESIGNER AND ERGONOMIST. SUITABLE
COMBINATIONS OF LIGHT SOURCE AND LUMINAIRE AND THE RELATIVE LOCATIONS OF ALL
THE ELEMENTS INVOLVED CAN PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS BUT DUE RECOGNITION
SHOULD BE PAID TO THE OPHTHALMIC REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATORS.
