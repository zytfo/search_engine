THE ROLE OF THE NETWORK IN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. EXAMINES NON-PROFIT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS TO ASSESS WHY THEY OFFER, OR PLAN TO OFFER ACQUISITIONS
SERVICES, WHAT MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN MAKE, AND THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF NETWORK ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
NETWORKS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITIONS
FUNCTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE NETWORKS CAN PROVIDE BOTH ACQUISITIONS
AND IN-PROCESS CONTROL OVER MATERIALS, THUS ALLOWING A LIBRARY TO OPERATE MORE
EFFICIENTLY WITH IMPROVED INTERNAL CONTROLS. AS A NETWORK SYSTEM WILL DISPLAY
MEMBER HOLDINGS, COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN WILL ALSO BE
FACILITATED.
