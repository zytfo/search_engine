DISCUSSES THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS
FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY-EDITORIAL AGREEMENT AND COMPULSORY
LEGAL DEPOSIT. TAKING AS CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION, EXHAUSTIVITY, REGULARITY AND
ACCURACY, EXAMINES 12 CURRENT AND RECENT PUBLICATIONS ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE
BIBLIOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY'S
BIBLIOGRAPHIC BULLETIN, AND A NUMBER OF PRODUCTIONS FROM COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS
AND INSTITUTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT UNTIL LEGAL DEPOSIT IS ENFORCED AND THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY BULLETIN ISSUED ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY
