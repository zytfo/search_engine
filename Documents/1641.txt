READERSHIP SURVEYS AND LOCAL LIBRARY CO-OPERATION.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF LITERATURE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH
RESEARCHERS AND LIBRARIANS ON READERSHIP SURVEYS AND LIBRARY COOPERATION IN
THE UK AND DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A STUDY INTO ACADEMIC
LIBRARY USE AND COOPERATION IN SCOTLAND. CONCLUDES THAT THERE CAN BE LITTLE
JUSTIFICATION IN SUCH A SURVEY, BUT THAT A SMALLER PROJECT ON HOW THE
INFORMATION NEEDS OF ACADEMICS ARE SATISFIED IN THEIR OWN INSTITUTION'S
LIBRARY WOULD BE USEFUL. SUGGESTS A METHODOLOGY FOR THE PROJECT.
