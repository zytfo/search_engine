EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA.

LIBRARIES IN MEETING THE READING NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THE EDUCATED PUBLIC IN
GHANA DUE TO INSUFFICIENT PROVISION OF FUNDS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, ABSENCE
OF READING HABITS IN GHANAIAN CULTURE, UNAWARENESS OF POTENTIAL VALUE OF
NON-BOOK MEDIA AS LEARNING RESOURCES AND UNSATISFACTORY TRAINING OF LIBRARY
STAFF. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING FACILITIES AND PERFORMANCE OF
SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS WELL AS THE TRAINING OF STAFF.
