A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WEST VIRGINIA LIBRARY HISTORY.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND THESES, INTENDED TO PROVIDE BASIC
COVERAGE OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE DEALING WITH WEST VIRGINIA LIBRARY
HISTORY. IN SOME CASES IT WAS FOUND TO BE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE CITATIONS, AND
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO EXAMINE MATERIALS. MANY WORKS IDENTIFIED NEITHER
PUBLISHER NOR PRINTER, NOR DID THEY IDENTIFY A CORPORATE BODY. ENTRIES ARE
ARRANGED ALPHABETICALLY BY TYPE OF LIBRARY AND NAME OF SPECIFIC LIBRARY OR
LIBRARY REGION.
