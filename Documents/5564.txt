STATE SUPPORT FOR ECCLESIASTICAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA.

DURING THE LAST 30 YEARS IT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES RUN BY THE CHURCHES IS NEEDED AT STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE
THEY ARE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. CHURCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACHIEVEMENTS AT THIS TIME
INCLUDE STOCK INCREASES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF STAFF TRAINING AND SOCIAL SERVICE
WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IT IS DISPUTED AS TO WHETHER THEY ARE RELIGIOUS RATHER
THAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND WHETHER CENTRALISED SERVICES FOR THEM ARE TOO
COSTLY. THE SMALLER BRANCHES COULD BE REGARDED AS A HINDRANCE TO THE MOBILE
LIBRARIES AND THE USE OF VOLUNTARY STAFF COULD BE AN EXCUSE NOT TO EMPLOY
FULL-TIME ADMINISTRATORS. A PLURALITY OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES CAN BE REGARDED
AS ECONOMIC. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS PROVIDED BY THE
STATE, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THE CHURCH LIBRARY MAY BE THE ONLY PUBLIC
LIBRARY.
