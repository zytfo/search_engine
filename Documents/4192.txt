PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSITY.
     
ARGUES THAT THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST SHOULD, IN MEDIATING BETWEEN PRODUCERS
AND CONSUMERS, EXERCISE DISCRIMINATION IN ASSESSING INFORMATION NEEDS AND
ADOPT A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH. DISCUSSES THE
QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF INFORMATION PRODUCTION PUBLISHED OVER THE LAST 20
YEARS, AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT BASED ON BAUDRILLARD'S
SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CONSUMPTION, EMPHASISING THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF
CONSUMER DEMANDS. IF THE SOCIOLOGICAL PRESSURES BEHIND USER NEEDS ARE
UNDERSTOOD, THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST IS THEN ABLE TO BOTH MONITOR USER
REQUIREMENTS AND EXERCISE SOME INFLUENCE OVER THE PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION
DESIGNED TO MEET SOCIAL PRESSURES RATHER THAN INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIVES.
