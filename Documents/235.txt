PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

UNTIL WELL INTO THE 70S TRADITIONAL INFORMATION CHANNELS WERE USED WHEN
DEALING WITH INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE EXPANSION OF RESEARCH IN
THE AREA NECESSITATED MORE PLANNED INFORMATION SERVICES. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT
OF THESES IS DUE TO THE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES, TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF
SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE NEEDS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION OUTSIDE
THEIR FIELD, TO THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO USE INFORMATION
SERVICES, AND TO THE LACK OF STANDARDISED TERMINOLOGY IN THE FIELD.
