READING RUSSIAN LITERATURE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT.
     
TRADITIONALLY RUSSIAN LITERATURE HAS TACKLED THE PROBLEMS OF MINORITY
NATIONALITIES, WHILE ITS WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION HAS HELPED BOND THOSE
PEOPLES TOGETHER. A RESEARCH PROJECT TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF RUSSIAN
LITERATURE TODAY ON NON-RUSSIAN PEOPLES WITHIN THE USSR WAS RECENTLY
UNDERTAKEN BY THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY. THE PROJECT CONSIDERED THE AVAILABILITY
OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT WAS READ AND THE VALUE
ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH READING. THE PROJECT IS INTENDED TO RECOMMEND TO LIBRARIES
LEVELS OF PROVISION AND METHODS OF PROMOTING SUCH LITERATURE, AND THE RESEARCH
METHODS USED WILL PROVIDE A FORMAT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS.
