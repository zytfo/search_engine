CENTRALISED BOOK DISTRIBUTION-A TOPIC OF THE DAY.
     
A STRONG PLEA FOR ESTABLISHING A NEW, CENTRALISED ENTERPRISE TO SUPPLY
LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WITH LITERATURE AND UP-TO-DATE
EQUIPMENT. ENTERPRISE OF THAT KIND HAD BEEN ENVISAGED ALREADY IN THE STATUTE
FOR THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA. SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS HAVE
BEEN IN OPERATION IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. THEY ARE OF INVALUABLE
ASSISTANCE TO LIBRARIANS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN SMALL LIBRARIES, WHO VERY
OFTEN LACK THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND WORK ONLY
PART-TIME. BOOKS ARE SELECTED, PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIES ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, THE CATALOGUE CARDS WITH
APPROPRIATE ANNOTATIONS BEING DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME. THUS, NEW
ACQUISITIONS ARE SELECTED EXPERTLY TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER RATIO BETWEEN
POLITICAL, FICTIONAL AND SPECIAL MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS ARE BY THESE MEANS
RELIEVED OF THE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF CATALOGUING, AND CAN DEVOTE
MORE TIME TO THEIR READERS, TO THEIR IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AND TO PROFESSIONAL
ADVANCEMENT.
