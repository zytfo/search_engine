SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABROAD' A FEW LESSONS OF AN
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY.
     
THE HUNGARIAN CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND METHODOLOGY CONDUCTED AN
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY BY QUESTIONNAIRE IN 1979/80 OF 47 SUBJECT
DEPARTMENTALISED PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ON THE BASIS OF THE REPLIES RECEIVED, THE
FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS WERE MADE' UNDER 3,000 SQ.M. BASIC AREA AND 300,000
VOLUMES IT IS NOT WORTHWHILE ESTABLISHING FULL SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS; MOVING TO
A NEW BUILDING GENERALLY ENCOURAGES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS;
THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES DEVELOP THE NEW STRUCTURE NOT IN 1 STEP BUT
GRADUALLY; SUBJECTIVE STANDPOINTS PREVAIL OFTEN IN THE DEMARCATION OF SUBJECT
DEPARTMENTS; WHEN SELECTING SPECIAL STAFF THOSE WITH LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONS
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER SPECIALISTS WHO ARE NOT LIBRARIANS.
