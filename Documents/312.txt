THE FEASIBILITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL MULTILATERAL UNESCO CONVENTION ON THE
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS.

THE ADOPTION OF A MULTILATERAL INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE UNIVERSAL
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP) IS THE BEST POSSIBLE GUARANTEE FOR THE
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE UNESCO
UAP CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN 1981-82. THIS CONVENTION SHOULD DECLARE THE
PRINCIPLE OF UAP AND SHOULD DETERMINE THE BASIC OBLIGATIONS OF NATIONAL
GOVERNMENTS IN THE CREATION OF THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF A UAP SYSTEM.
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED ARE THE ROLES OF UNESCO AND IFLA,
FORMATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL COLLECTION OF PUBLICATIONS, ADJUSTMENTS OF
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF UAP, AND PROVISION FOR
A SPECIAL UNESCO FUND FOR UAP. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
