THE CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN OLD BAVARIA AND SWABIA.
     
THROUGH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES IN 1803, BAVARIAN LIBRARIES
ACQUIRED MANY MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS, MAINLY OF CHORAL AND INSTRUMENTAL WORKS FROM
ABOUT 1750 ONWARDS. SINCE 1958 RENEWED EFFORTS AT CATALOGUING HAVE BEEN MADE,
WITH HELP, SINCE 1964, FROM THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN
RESEARCH ASSOCIATION) AND THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY. SINCE 1971 3 CATALOGUE
SECTIONS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND OTHERS ARE IN COURSE OF PREPARATION. THE
CATALOGUES ARE IMPORTANT SINCE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC IS RARELY FOUND IN PUBLIC
COLLECTIONS; BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES OF LITTLE-KNOWN COMPOSERS ARE INCLUDED. THE
COLLECTION ALSO INCLUDES EARLY WORKS BY WELL-KNOWN COMPOSERS SUCH AS MOZART
AND MICHAEL HAYDN. 3 COLLECTIONS OWNED BY NOBLE FAMILIES AND SOME MATERIAL
BELONGING TO THE NATION ARE ALSO RECORDED. THE 6 VOLUMES ALREADY PUBLISHED OF
THE 2CATALOGUE OF BAVARIAN MUSIC COLLECTIONS1 ARE DESCRIBED.
