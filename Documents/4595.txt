LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SECONDARY TEACHING. RESULTS OF RECENT
AMERICAN AND CANADIAN RESEARCH.
     
EXTRACT FROM A PROJECT FOR A THESIS IN EDUCATION SCIENCES PREPARED FOR THE
UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL. AMERICAN THESES FROM 1976-77 TO 1980-81 ON SECONDARY
SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE TOPICS OF MEDIA PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,
AND USE, WHEREAS IN QUEBEC INTEREST HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY ON USE. THE
RESULTS OF RESEARCH ON USE ARE SUMMARISED, AND THE SITUATION IN THE USA IN
GENERAL COMPARED WITH QUEBEC. QUEBEC SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE, AND IS FAR FROM
MOVING TOWARDS THE AMERICAN CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY AS CENTRAL TO ALL
TEACHING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH THE REASONS FOR THIS
DEVELOPING CRISIS.
