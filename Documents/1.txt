THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.
