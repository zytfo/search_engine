CAN THE LEAN YEARS GIVE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES NEW OPPORTUNITIES?.

THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY'S MAIN TASKS REMAIN THOSE OF A CENTURY AGO:- TO
ENCOURAGE APTITUDES AND SKILLS, TO DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE, BOTH THROUGH FICTION
AND FACTUAL BOOKS, TO PROVIDE EXPERIENCE, WHETHER FROM INFORMATIVE
NON-FICTION, SATISFYING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY, OR FROM FICTION, ALLOWING FOR
EMOTIONAL IDENTIFICATION, TO EDUCATE, ESPECIALLY IDEOLOGICALLY. SOME NORWEGIAN
COMMUNITIES STILL MAINTAIN STRICT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS BOOK SELECTION
STANDARDS; LIBRARIANS MUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR OWN SELECTION CRITERIA.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST PUBLICISE THEIR WORK AND PROBLEMS, COOPERATING
WHERE POSSIBLE WITH THE MASS MEDIA, AND MAKE THE 1980S A DECADE OF
OPPORTUNITY.
