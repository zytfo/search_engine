TWO-YEAR COLLEGE LIBRARIES' A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF ACRL 2STANDARDS.
     
THE ANALYSIS OF 1977 HIGHER EDUCATION GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEYS (HEGIS) DATA
FOR 2-YEAR COLLEGE LIBRARIES IN TERMS OF THE 1979 ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES (ACRL) 2STANDARDS 1SHOWS THAT A MAJORITY DO NOT MEET THE
STANDARDS IN RESPECT TO NEARLY ALL THE VARIABLES AVAILABLE FOR STUDY. HEGIS
DATA DO NOT INCLUDE MEASURES OF SOME IMPORTANT FACTORS SUCH AS SPACE AND
EQUIPMENT, AND NOT ALL DATA ARE GATHERED IN TERMS THAT MATCH THE 2STANDARDS'
1DEFINITIONS. INCREASED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO BRING THE LIBRARIES OF
THE USA'S 2-YEAR SCHOOLS UP TO STANDARD.
