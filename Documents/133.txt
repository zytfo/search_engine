THE GREAT EITHER/OR DEBATE; OR COPING WITH THE CULTURAL CONTINUUM.(P

APER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL GATHERING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL 12 APR 80.) DISCUSSION OF POPULAR CULTURE IN
LIBRARIES, REVIEWING THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEFINING 'POPULAR CULTURE', AND
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN POPULAR, HIGH AND MASS CULTURE. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SUPPORTS POPULAR CULTURE IN TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS,
REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND, EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC CLASS, BUT IS IN A CATCH-22
SITUATION OF TRYING TO RESPOND AT ALL LEVELS, BUT WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WITH THE
BEST IN EACH OF THESE LEVELS; THUS THE LIBRARIAN MUST STILL BE SELECTIVE, AND
ACCORDINGLY REJECT WORKS WHICH SOME MAY STILL WANT OR NEED.
