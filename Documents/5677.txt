BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES ON A PROTEIN-RICH CROP: THE COWPEA.

2 BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON COWPEAS, ONE COVERING THE PERIOD 1888-1949 AND THE OTHER
1950-1973, WERE ANALYSED TO STUDY VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LITERATURE.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT GROWTH OF THE LITERATURE HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL, DOUBLING
EVERY 20 YEARS, WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 87% OF THE
LITERATURE. THOUGH THE PERIODICAL WAS THE MOST POPULAR PUBLISHING MEDIUM,
FORMAT CHANGES WERE EVIDENT AND BRADFORD DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 2 GROUPS
RESULTED IN A THIRD BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION WHEN MERGED.
