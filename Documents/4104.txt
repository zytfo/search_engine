PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
STATISTICS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY FOR 1976-80 REVEAL INCREASES IN
STOCKS, LOANS AND USERS. IN 1980 STOCKS TOTALLED OVER 36 MILLION ITEMS, LOANS
OVER 79 MILLION AND READERS OVER 3 MILLION. DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY
SLOWER THAN DURING THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS, PARTLY BECAUSE A HIGH STANDARD HAD
ALREADY BEEN REACHED AND PARTLY BECAUSE MORE ORGANISATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE
REQUIRED. PLANS FOR STOCK EXPANSION HAVE GONE AHEAD BECAUSE THE STATE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION FIGURES HAVE INCREASED. THE PLANNED TOTAL
STOCK EXPANSION FIGURE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED AND EFFORTS WERE MADE TO KEEP STOCKS
UP TO DATE. TOTAL LIBRARY EXPENDITURE IN 1980 WAS 111,642,600 M, REFLECTING
CONTINUAL INCREASES IN EXPENDITURE.
