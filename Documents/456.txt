WHY PRODUCE CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN THE NETHERLANDS?.

MORE THAN 100 CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE BEING PUBLISHED AT THE PRESENT TIME
IN THE NETHERLANDS. IN THE PAST MANY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE CURRENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIES HAVE FAILED FROM LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IN THE FIELD OF
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPUTER ENABLING COMPLEX SEARCHES TO BE MADE RAPIDLY ON
VERY LARGE DATA BASES. MAJOR REASONS FOR PRODUCING A CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY
INCLUDE THE WISH TO KEEP ABREAST OF MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN OR ABOUT AN
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY OR REGION AND THE DESIRE TO MAKE SCATTERED REFERENCES ON A
PARTICULAR SUBJECT MORE READILY AVAILABLE. IN FUTURE THE EMPHASIS IN
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL WILL BE ON MORE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE.
