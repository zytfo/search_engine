NORDINFO COURSE IN BIBLIOMETRICS, 1981-10-26-29, HANASSARI, HELSINKI,
SWEDISH-FINNISH CULTURAL CENTRE (IN SWEDISH).

DESCRIBES THE DISCIPLINE OF BIBLIOMETRICS WITH REFERENCE TO A NORDINFO COURSE
ATTENDED IN HELSINKI. DEFINES BIBLIOMETRICS AS QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE USED ON A GLOBAL SCALE, BUT
THEY CAN ALSO BE A TOOL TO CALCULATE THE BEST USE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY'S
RESOURCES. AMONG THE EMPIRICAL LAWS DEVELOPED, BRADFORD'S LAW IS THE MOST
APPLICABLE. DESCRIBES THE USE OF THIS LAW TO OBTAIN A GRAPH WITH AN
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING PART, A SO-CALLED BRADFORD GRAPH. THIS CAN SHOW THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTHORS AND NUMBER OF ARTICLES, ARTICLES AND QUOTATIONS
AND CAN HELP TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS OF OBSOLESCENCE OF LITERATURE IN A
LIBRARY. OTHER BIBLIOMETRIC LAWS ARE THOSE OF LOTKA AND ZIPF. THE METHODS ARE
USEFUL IN ACQUISITION, PLANNING OF SPACE ALLOCATION, WITHDRAWALS, LIBRARY USE,
AND OTHER AREAS OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION.
