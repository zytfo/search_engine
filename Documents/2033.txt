GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION LIBRARY COMMITTEE.
     
AT ITS SPRING MEETING THE COMMITTEE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY IN BONN OVER THE 2-YEAR PERIOD
1982-84, TO BRING IT UP TO THE STANDARD OF OTHER FACULTY LIBRARIES NOW THAT
SUITABLE PREMISES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IN BERLIN A PERIODICAL DATA BANK
WILL LINK THE FEDERAL STATES AND WILL INCLUDE HOLDINGS OF THE MAIN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS. THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS IN
SETTING UP AN INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE ARTS. IT WAS DECIDED TO PUBLISH A
CATALOGUE OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL AT GOTTINGEN AND TO PUT ON FILM THE CENTRAL
CATALOGUE FOR NORTH RHINELAND/WESTPHALIA.
