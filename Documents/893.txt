WILL VIEWDATA SYSTEMS BE USED IN EDUCATION?.

AN INTRODUCTION TO VIEWDATA SYSTEMS IS PROVIDED AS A BASIS FOR STUDYING THEIR
POTENTIAL FOR EDUCATIONAL USE. THE BBC ARE ALREADY CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS TO
USE CEEFAX IN EDUCATION AND COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO FALL AS APPLICATION BECOMES
MORE WIDESPREAD. VIEWDATA SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VERSATILE AND WILL
PROBABLY BE USED MOST IN SPECIALISED EDUCATION RATHER THAN THE MORE GENERAL
FIELD. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED TERMINALS
CONNECTED IN CLUSTERS OVER A SINGLE TELEPHONE LINE, IMPROVED GRAPHICS
FACILITIES, AND THE LINKING OF SMALL IN-HOUSE SYSTEMS TO THE NATIONAL PRESTEL
NETWORK AS MORE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACQUIRE THEIR OWN COMPUTERS.
