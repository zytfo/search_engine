LIBRARIES AS MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRES; THE DANISH EXPERIENCE.

TALK GIVEN TO THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING HELD IN STOCKHOLM AUG 80. THE
DANISH LOCAL AUTHORITY REFORMS OF 1970 AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING ACT OF
1977, WHICH EXTENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, INTENSIFIED THE DEMAND FOR A
MORE EFFICIENT PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICE. TO SATISFY THIS DEMAND THE STATE
INFORMATION OFFICE FOR DISTRIBUTION OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION WAS SET UP IN
1977 AND COOPERATION WITH LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED. THE REPORT ON 'LOCAL
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY' STIMULATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC INFORMATION
SERVICES IN LIBRARIES. THE 'KOMMUNE-INFORMATION' AT THE TOWN LIBRARY OF
LYNGBY-TAARBAEK WAS SET UP IN 1977. IT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE REFERENCE ROOM
AND STAFFED BY 1 FULL-TIME LIBRARIAN. CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE TOWN HALL
EXISTS AND CONTACT PERSONS IN EACH DEPARTMENT WERE APPOINTED. ALL MATERIAL
AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO KOMMUNE-INFORMATION IS CATALOGUED AND DISPLAYED AND SOME
MAY BE BORROWED. AN INFORMATIO N INDEX OF LOCAL ITEMS IS BEING BUILT UP.
AROUND 400 ENQUIRIES A MONTH ARE DEALT WITH, SOME BY REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT
DEPARTMENT, OTHERS DIRECTLY, CONCERNING' DECISIONS MADE, RIGHTS AND DUTIES,
ON-GOING PROJECTS, LOCAL GROUPS AND SOCIETIES. DESPITE THE NEED FEW OTHER
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOLLOWED THIS EXAMPLE.
