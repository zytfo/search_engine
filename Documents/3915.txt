PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE.
     
SINCE THE MID-60S COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN USED IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO FULFIL 2
MAIN FUNCTIONS; HOUSEKEEPING ROUTINES AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE ADVENT OF
ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING SERVICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 70S, AND VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS
AVAILABLE TOWARDS THE END OF THE 70S HAVE PROVIDED BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A
CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITIES.
