LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS IN TRANSITION: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE 1980'S.

LIBRARIANS HAVE LEARNT THAT AUTOMATION IS MORE DIFFICULT AND WILL TAKE LONGER
THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT; SOME FUNCTIONS ARE BETTER CARRIED OUT THROUGH
NETWORKS; ALTHOUGH COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS ARE MORE POWERFUL AND MORE VERSATILE
THAN THE MANUAL SYSTEMS THEY REPLACE, THEY CAN ALSO BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN (AT LEAST DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD); AND
COMPUTERISATION IMPOSES MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS OF ACCURACY ON LIBRARY
OPERATIONS. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS DURING
THE NEXT DECADE AND SUGGESTS THAT THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES GROUP, INC. (A
GROWING PARTNERSHIP OF 25 LIBRARIES TRYING TO COLLECTIVELY MAINTAIN AND EXPAND
THEIR CAPABILITIES USING NEW TECHNOLOGY EVEN IN THE FACE OF DIMINISHING
RESOURCES) COULD SERVE AS A MODEL AND INSPIRATION FOR OTHER GROUPS WORLDWIDE.
