CHEMLINE' A CHEMICAL STRUCTURE SEARCH KEY TO BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION.
     
THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S ON-LINE CHEMICAL DICTIONARY FILE
(CHEMLINE) IS PRIMARILY USED TO ENHANCE THE RETRIEVAL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES. DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF
CHEMLINE AS A MECHANISM TO LINK CHEMICAL STRUCTURES TO BIOLOGICAL DATA. SEARCH
TECHNIQUES ARE DEVELOPED TO INTEGRATE CLASSES OF STRUCTURALLY-RELATED CHEMICAL
WITH TOXICITY DATA AND INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ON-LINE RETRIEVAL FILES SUCH
AS THE REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS) AND TOXLINE.
