INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF INFORMATION.
     
IN DEALING WITH THEORIES OF INFORMATION RATHER THAN OF DOCUMENTATION, ONE
NEEDS TO USE THE SAME LOGARITHMIC MEASURES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AS ARE
USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERNAL INFORMATION PROCESSES OF THE COMPUTER.
ONE WOULD THEN BE DEALING WITH INFORMATION OBJECTIVELY THROUGHOUT, RATHER THAN
A MIX OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASURES. INFORMATION 2PER SE1 IS AN EMPTY
CONCEPT. MAN NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO RELATE INFORMATION MORE DIRECTLY TO
KNOWLEDGE, AS A 1ST STEP OBSERVING THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES IN
COMPACT FIELDS OF SCIENCE. A FIRMER METAPHYSIC FOR SUCH STUDIES IS NEEDED.
