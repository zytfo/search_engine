POLIS' PARLIAMENTARY ONLINE INFORMATION SYSTEM.

MPS AT THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVE URGENT INFORMATION NEEDS. THE HOUSE
OF COMMONS LIBRARY PRODUCES 9 STRIP INDEXES OF INFORMATION, BUT THESE HAVE
DISADVANTAGES, IN THAT ENTRIES USUALLY APPEAR UNDER 1 HEADING, ONLY SELECTED
PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN INDEXED, AND THE LIBRARY'S 3 LOCATIONS MAKE
ACCESS DIFFICULT. IN 1979 A NEW DATA BASE WAS BEGUN, AND IT WILL FORM A SINGLE
INDEX TO ALL MATERIAL PREVIOUSLY HELD ON STRIP INDEXES, AND OTHER INFORMATION
SUCH AS PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS. DESCRIBES THE INPUT FLOW FOR THE NEW ON-LINE
DATA BASE-POLIS, AND DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ARE GIVEN.
