REPRESENTATIONS, PROCESSES, MEMORY MECHANISMS: THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF
COGNITION.

EVERY COGNITIVE SKILL DRAWS UPON PART OF THE BRAIN'S EXTENSIVE REPERTOIRE OF
REPRESENTATIONAL SUBSYSTEMS, STORAGE MECHANISMS, AND PROCESSES. THIS TUTORIAL
ARTICLE IS AN INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH EXPLORING THESE BASIC COMPONENTS OF
COGNITIVE SKILL AND THEIR ORGANISATION. 4 AREAS OF RESEARCH ARE REVIEWED: THE
PERCEPTION OF OBJECTS AND WORDS; THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM
MEMORY MECHANISMS; THE RETRIEVAL OF REMEMBERED EPISODES AND FACTS; ATTENTION,
PERFORMANCE, AND CONSCIOUSNESS.
