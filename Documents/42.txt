MARKET RECEPTIVITY FOR AN EXTENDED M.L.S.

AS PART OF ITS STUDY OF AN EXTENDED MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMME, THE GRADUATE
SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN
DISTRIBUTED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO A REPRESENTATIVE CROSS-SECTION OF PUBLIC,
ACADEMIC, SCHOOL, AND SPECIAL LIBRARIANS, SOLICITING THEIR RESPONSES TO THE
RELATIVE MERITS OF (1) A 1-YEAR VERSUS EXTENDED MASTER'S PROGRAMME IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE AND (2) A 1-YEAR MASTER'S IN LIBRARY SCIENCE WITH AND WITHOUT A 2ND
MASTER'S IN ANOTHER SUBJECT. THE RESPONSES INDICATED THAT RESPONDENTS WERE
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN IN TERMS
OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND NEEDS IN LIBRARIES. THE SURVEY RESULTS ARE THUS
BEST DESCRIBED AS USEFUL BUT INCONCLUSIVE.
