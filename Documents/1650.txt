DEVELOPMENT WORK.

LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM BY STUDYING (1) THE EXTENT TO WHICH RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) STAFF INFORMATION NEEDS ARE SATISFIED AND (2) THE
INFLUENCE OF THE SYSTEM ON THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OF THE R&D WORK.
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY CAN BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO R&D STAFF TIME SAVED THROUGH
