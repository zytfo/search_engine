COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
A SCHEME FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN
BULGARIA HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS SINCE 1978 AND ALL MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND CENTRAL
REGIONAL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 8
SERIES ARE PLANNED, INCLUDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CONTEMPORARY BULGARIAN
LITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, DISSERTATIONS, GRAMOPHONE RECORDS, AND BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AND
ARTICLES IN DAILY PAPERS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FOREIGN
LITERATURE ON BULGARIA, TOGETHER WITH 1 OF BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE
FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION WILL RANGE FROM 1 WEEK, AS IN THE CASE OF CATALOGUE
CARDS, THROUGH BI-WEEKLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BULLETINS TO ANNUAL INDEXES OR
EVEN CUMULATIVE INDEXES PUBLISHED ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. THE INTRODUCTION OF AN
APPROPRIATE SYSTEM, INCLUDING MINICOMPUTERS AND VIDEOTERMINI, MUST BE
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF UPDATED NATIONAL STANDARDS ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DESCRIPTION, COMPILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, ISBD(M)
AND ISBD(S).
