DOCUMENTATION OF UN AND OAU.

PLEADS FOR A CHANGED ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PUBLICATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS. STRESSES THE VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE PUBLICATIONS OF
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE UNO AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN
UNITY, AND ADVOCATES THAT GREATER PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE EXPLOITATION
OF THIS LITERATURE. A CHANGED ATTITUDE IS NECESSARY TO GIVE INTERNATIONAL
LITERATURE SIMILAR PRIORITY TO THAT GIVEN TO NATIONAL LITERATURE.
