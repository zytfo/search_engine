BAKER'S STRATEGY FLOUNDERS.

A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE UK'S MINISTER FOR INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY KENNETH BAKER DURING HIS 1ST YEAR OF OFFICE, INCLUDING INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY YEAR. LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT PLANS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND
LIST PROJECTS OF 1981. WITHOUT THE POLITICAL MUSCLE OF A FULL MINISTRY WITH
ITS OWN BUDGET AND INFLUENCE IN THE CABINET, EVERYTHING BAKER TRIES TO DO WILL
INEVITABLY BE TACTICAL RATHER THAN STRATEGIC, AND RESPONSIVE RATHER THAN TRULY
INITIATING.
