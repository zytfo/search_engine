THE EFFECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ON STAFF AND READERS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.
     
RESEARCH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND
NEGLECTED THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS, SO THAT OPINION ON THE POSITIVE AND
NEGATIVE EFFECTS IS SHARPLY DIVIDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AUTOMATION IS TO
INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY PROCEDURES; SERVICE CHANGES ARE STILL
REGARDED AS SIDE-EFFECTS. AUTOMATION'S VALUE MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF THE
AVERAGE NON-ACADEMIC READER. THE TIME SAVED FOR STAFF THROUGH AUTOMATION OF
ROUTINE PROCEDURES MUST BE USED FOR READER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICH
FURTHER STAFF TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCES IN THIS
FIELD FROM LIBRARIES ABROAD SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY.
