IT'S A SQUASH IN NAESTVED.
     
REPORT ON NAESTVED PUBLIC LIBRARY, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH USERS AND THE
LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARY IS CENTRALLY PLACED, HAS A TOTAL OF 1614 SQ.M. ON 3
FLOORS AND EMPLOYS 36 STAFF. WITH A POPULATION OF 45,000, NAESTVED NOW NEEDS A
MAIN LIBRARY OF 4000 SQ.M. IN ADDITION TO THE PLANNED BRANCH LIBRARY SERVING
THE TOWN'S EAST END. INTERVIEWS USERS OF THE NEWSPAPER READING ROOM, THE
GENERAL LENDING SECTION, THE MUSIC LIBRARY, WHICH LENDS RECORDS AND TAPES, AND
THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY; MOST OF THESE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES. CUTS
HAVE NOT AFFECTED ACQUISITIONS AS MUCH AS FEARED, BUT SERVICES SUCH AS THE
HOME LOAN SERVICE TO THE ELDERLY AND THE MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES ARE
OVERSTRETCHED, AND SPACE FOR MEETINGS AND ARRANGEMENTS IS INADEQUATE. FILMS
ARE SHOWN IN THE LOCAL CINEMA.
