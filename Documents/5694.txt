IN CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS,
HANS DE BOER.

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH HANS DE BOER, MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION AND
SOCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE NETHERLANDS. DE BOER FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE NEW PUBLIC
SERVICES ACT WHICH WILL DECENTRALISE RUNNING OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. DE BOER BELIEVES
THAT INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES IS
THE BEST GUARANTEE FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE. PLANS FOR
EXTENDING THE AGE LIMIT FOR FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP FROM 16 TO 18 YEARS
OF AGE HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY DE BOER BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL CUTBACKS IN
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THE ALTERNATIVE, DE BOER BELIEVES, WOULD HAVE BEEN A
REDUCTION IN THE STANDARD OF SERVICE.
