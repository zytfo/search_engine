CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION' THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CASSAVA INFORMATION CENTER AT
CIAT.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES IN 1979 ON COMMUNICATION
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS (IARCS),
DESCRIBING THE NEW APPROACH TO HANDLING TECHNICAL INFORMATION RECENTLY
INTRODUCED AT THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR TROPICAL AGRICULTURE (CIAT).
CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION IS A WHOLISTIC APPROACH TO INFORMATION,
COMMUNICATION, AND RESEARCH. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE THEORETICAL BASIS, WITH
AN OUTLINE OF SERVICES OFFERED AT THE CASSAVA INFORMATION CENTER AS
ILLUSTRATION. RECENT THEORIES ABOUT INFORMATION COMMUNICATION, AND RESEARCH
EVIDENCE, ARE ADDUCED AS CORROBORATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION
CONCEPT, WITH REFERENCE TO THE LITERATURE. IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD IS
RECOMMENDED TO IARCS AS A POTENTIALLY HIGHLY EFFICIENT APPROACH TO INFORMATION
HANDLING, WITH IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR NETWORKING ACTIVITIES.
