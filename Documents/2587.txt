AVOIDING THE WORST' THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF THE STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN
BURGHAUSEN.
     
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE HELD IN SEPT/OCT 81, WITH A CENTRAL THEME OF
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS. SUBJECTS COVERED INCLUDED' THE
FORESEEABLE AND UNFORESEEABLE ASPECTS OF LIBRARY PLANNING; THE TASKS AND
FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPATIAL PLANNING; AND
LITERATURE PROVISION WITHIN RURAL CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. WARNINGS WERE GIVEN
AGAINST EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS PROVIDED WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND
AGAINST RESIGNATION IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES. A BROADLY BASED,
DECENTRALISED LENDING SYSTEM SHOULD CATER FOR BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED
REQUIREMENTS. THE STATE SHOULD SUPPORT AND COMPLEMENT LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICES
BUT REFRAIN FROM EXCESSIVE INTERFERENCE IN THEM. BAVARIA IS THE STATE THAT HAS
MADE MOST PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION; ITS STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME REFLECTS
THE IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMATIC PLANNING.
