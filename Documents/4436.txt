DOCUMENT: 'LIBRARY ORGANISATION IN ERETZ-YISRAEL' (IN HEBREW).
     
FISHMAN STUDIED LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE USA IMMEDIATELY AFTER WORLD WAR I AND IT
IS THEN THAT HE WROTE THIS ARTICLE, ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN HAPOEL HATZAIR.
LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN ERETZ-YISRAEL ARE UNPLANNED AND NOT SYSTEMATIC, BECAUSE
THEY ARE BASED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON GIFTS, RATHER THAN PURCHASES. LIBRARIANS
MUST NOT OBLIGATE THEMSELVES TO CATALOGUE GIFT COLLECTIONS IN TOTO, BUT MUST
LEAVE THEMSELVES FREE TO CHOOSE ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED AND TO GIVE AWAY OR
EXCHANGE THE REST. HE CALLS FOR THE FOUNDATION OF A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE
IN JERUSALEM WITH FAR-REACHING CENTRALISED POWERS TO TRANSFER BOOKS FROM 1
LIBRARY TO OTHERS WHERE THEY WILL BE MORE USEFUL.
