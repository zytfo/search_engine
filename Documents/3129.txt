THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED READERS MUST BE GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY.
     
DESCRIBES THE WORK OF ARHUS PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AV DEPARTMENT, OPENED IN DEC 80.
THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDES RECORD PLAYERS, TAPE RECORDERS, SCREENS FOR SLIDES AND
TRANSCRIPT READERS FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TEXT. THE STOCK INCLUDES BOOKS WITH
TAPES, TALKING BOOKS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, ART SLIDES, NON-MUSICAL RECORDS
AND CASSETTES, EASY READERS, PICTORIAL WORKS AND MAGNAPRINT BOOKS. THE USERS
ARE THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED, MOSTLY THE ELDERLY, AND THOSE WITH
READING DIFFICULTIES, MOSTLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. NOT ALL MATERIALS,
E.G. THE LANGUAGE COURSES AND ART SLIDES, ARE AIMED AT THE HANDICAPPED.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE HANDICAPPED PLACES GREATER DEMANDS ON THE STAFF THAN
OTHER LENDING SERVICES. FEW USERS ARE ABLE TO HELP THEMSELVES TO MATERIAL AND
NEED ASSISTANCE FROM THE STAFF; MOST MATERIAL NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED AND PLAYED
BEFORE BORROWING AND CHECKING ON RETURN. THE DEPARTMENT BUYS PUBLISHED
EDITIONS OF BOOKS CUM TAPES, AND ALSO RECORDS SUITABLE BOOKS ITSELF, BUT
DEMAND FOR MATERIAL IS FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED.
