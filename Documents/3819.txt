THE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION AT TWENTY-FIVE.
     
THE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION (RTSD) OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HAS HAD A PRODUCTIVE 25 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT HAS ENCOUNTERED
ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES AT BOTH ASSOCIATION AND DIVISION LEVELS, ITS AREAS OF
RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS STRUCTURE HAVE REMAINED THE SAME SINCE 1957. RTSD
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN ALL AREAS OF DIVISION RESPONSIBILITY. STANDARDS,
PUBLISHING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY STRONG PROGRAMMES.
THE PROGNOSIS FOR THE DIVISION'S FUTURE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT IS STRENGTHENING
PROGRAMMES THAT SUPPORT ITS 1979 GOALS.
