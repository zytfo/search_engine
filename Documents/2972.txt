THE STATE OF BIBLIOGRAPHY IN HUNGARY.
     
REVIEWS PROGRESS MADE IN THE COMPILATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN HUNGARY SINCE
THE NATIONAL WORKING CONFERENCE ON BIBLIOGRAPHY IN 1961 HAD IDENTIFIED LARGE
GAPS IN COVERAGE AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION. THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI LIBRARY
HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AN UP-TO-DATE SYSTEM FOR THE
HUNGARIAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; THE GREATEST BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE PERIOD
1921-44. PROGRESS IN SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES HAS BEEN HAPHAZARD WITH OVERLAP IN
SOME FIELDS WHILE CERTAIN OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS HAVE NO
CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES. IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT WITHOUT A COORDINATING BODY TO
PLAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACTIVITIES, IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HAVE A COMPLETE
SYSTEM OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN HUNGARY.
