ON THE SITUATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.

A SHORT REPORT WAS MADE ON THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NORTH
RHINE-WESTPHALIA (NRW) ON 20 AUG 80 AT THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEETING OF THE
CITIES' ASSEMBLY OF NRW IN DUISBURG. A TOTAL OF 18 MILLION BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE
IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW FOR A POPULATION OF 17 MILLION. THIS DOES NOT
COMPARE WELL WITH FIGURES OF 5, 6 OR EVEN 8-10 BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION IN
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE TARGET FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW IS 2 BOOKS
PER HEAD BUT EVEN THIS FIGURE WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IN THE FACE OF
RISING BOOK COSTS AND A STATIC ACQUISITION BUDGET. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL
NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES IN THE LARGER TOWNS THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS UNEVENLY
DISTRIBUTED AND HARDLY EXISTS AT ALL IN SOME COUNTRY AREAS. THE LIBRARIANS
HAVE PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS FOR A LIBRARY LAW AIMED AT IMPROVING THE
SITUATION TO THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION.
