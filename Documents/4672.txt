THE BACKGROUND TO A ZEELAND AMALGAMATION' THE ZEELAND PROVINCIAL LIBRARY AND
THE MIDDLEBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL OF ZEELAND AND THE CITY COUNCIL OF
MIDDLEBURG IN 1981 AGREED JOINTLY TO PROVIDE *67 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A NEW LIBRARY. THE BUILDING WHICH IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN 1974 WILL HOUSE
THE COMBINED PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE ZEELAND CENTRAL
MUSIC LIBRARY. LACK OF SPACE IN THE PRESENT LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THE NEED FOR
CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES LED TO THE
DECISION TO COMBINE THEIR SERVICES. THE NEW BUILDING WILL HAVE A SURFACE AREA
OF 12,000 SQ.M. ON 5 FLOORS WITH SPACE FOR 100 STAFF AND EMPHASIS WILL BE
PLACED ON THE USE OF NEW TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS AUTOMATION AND THE ACQUISITION
AND STORAGE OF NEW TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, INCLUDING AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS.
