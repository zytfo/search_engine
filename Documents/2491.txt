A STUDY OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION COMMITTEE OF THE
ROYAL SOCIETY. THE MAJOR CONCLUSION IS THAT A COMBINATION OF PRESSURES WILL
VERY SOON PUT THE UK'S SCHOLARLY SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION SYSTEM UNDER
CONSIDERABLE STRAIN. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE EXTRA FUNDING. 2 MAIN
POSSIBILITIES ARE A SUBSIDY OF PUBLICATIONS AND INCREASED PROVISION FOR
LIBRARIES (ENABLING THEM TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS AND
THUS ALSO GENERATING INCOME FOR THE PUBLISHERS).
