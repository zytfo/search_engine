LEGAL INFORMATION IN THE USA.
     
SINCE THE EARLY 1970S, 2 COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEGAL RESEARCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE USA, LEXIS AND WESTLAW. IN ADDITION, THE US
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS CREATED THE JURIS DATABANK FOR THE USE OF FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES AND THE CONGRESS HAS MADE LEGIS, WHICH WAS COMPILED FOR USE BY ITS
OWN STAFF, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE USERS ON A LIMITED BASIS. ALL
STUDENT LAWYERS IN THE US RECEIVE AS PART OF THEIR TRAINING A COURSE ON LEGAL
RESEARCH AND WRITING, INVOLVING THE USE OF TRADITIONAL AND AUTOMATED LIBRARY
SYSTEMS. IN FUTURE, THEREFORE, IT IS LIKELY THAT LAWYERS WILL EXPECT A MORE
COMPREHENSIVE AND UP-TO-DATE SERVICE FROM THEIR LIBRARIES.
