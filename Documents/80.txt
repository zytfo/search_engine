BERNE MUNICIPAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY: EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT 1980.

LOANS HAVE INCREASED BY ALMOST 15% DURING THE YEAR. SCHOOL CHILDREN NOW
COMPRISE 1/3 OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS. IN SPITE OF A LARGER BOOK FUND,
FEWER PURCHASES THAN LAST YEAR WERE MADE BUT STAFF ARE CATCHING UP ON THE
CATALOGUING BACKLOG. SHORTAGE OF SPACE IS A PROBLEM; THE LIBRARY MUST PLAY A
KEY ROLE IN UNIVERSITY PLANNING. BECAUSE OF PROCESSING, STORAGE AND RUNNING
COSTS, EACH BOOK COSTS MORE THAN ITS PURCHASING PRICE; THE USE OF ELECTRONIC
DATA PROCESSING WILL NOT SAVE MUCH MONEY BUT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES. WORK IS
PROCEEDING ON THE BUHLPLATZ FACULTY LIBRARY, TO BE OPENED IN AUTUMN 81, WHERE
BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MATERIAL FROM VARIOUS INSTITUTE LIBRARIES WILL BE
AMALGAMATED.
