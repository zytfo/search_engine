BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO CURRICULUM GUIDES.
     
CURRICULUM GUIDES ARE AN IMPORTANT AND HEAVILY USED RESOURCE IN EDUCATION
LIBRARIES AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS CENTRES. GAINING ACCESS TO THESE
MATERIALS, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING, AS MOST CURRICULUM
GUIDES HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN INDEXED IN A CENTRAL SOURCE. FEARON-PITMAN
PUBLISHERS INC. HAS ATTEMPTED TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BY PUBLISHING THE
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT LIBRARY, THE 1ST SET OF WHICH CONTAINED 905 CURRICULUM
GUIDES ON MICROFICHE WITH HARD COPY INDEXES. THE PUBLISHER EXPECTS TO PUBLISH
THIS SET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-ST. LOUIS OWNS THE
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT LIBRARY, AND THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES ITS USE IN THE
EDUCATION LIBRARY.
