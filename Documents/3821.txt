HEADACHES, INFILTRATIONS AND FLICKERING BEFORE THE EYES.
     
DISCUSSES AUTOMATION IN ROSKILDE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (ROSKILDE
UNIVERSITETSBIBLIOTEK (RUB)). INTRODUCTION OF THE SAMKAT-PROJECT, A JOINT,
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES, OPENS THE POSSIBILITY
OF COORDINATING ACCESSIONS AND CATALOGUING, BUT PROBLEMS WITH JOB DISTRIBUTION
WILL BE INEVITABLE AND SHOULD BE FACED. THE STANDARDS SPECIFICATION GROUP IN
ITS PRELIMINARY REPORTS ON ACCESSION SYSTEMS HAVE SKETCHED A SYSTEM VERY LIKE
THE ONE USED AT RUB. WHEN THE LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1971 IT ADOPTED THE
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM OF DENMARK'S TECHNICAL LIBRARY. THIS WAS
DEVELOPED INTO AN ISSUE AND ACCESSION SYSTEM, BUT NOT WITHOUT TEETHING
TROUBLES. IT HAS NEVERTHELESS BROUGHT ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS TRANSFER OF WORK
FROM ROUTINE PROCESSES TO SERVICES. THE SYSTEM'S OUTPUT INCLUDES' ORDER FORMS
IN FICHE OF BOOKS ON ORDER, BUDGET CONTROL WHICH GIVES ACCOUNTS BY SUBJECT,
REMINDER LISTS OF BOOKS NOT YET DELIVERED BY THE  BOOKSELLER, LISTS OF NEW
ACQUISITIONS. AS PRINTING IS EXCLUDED ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS, PROBLEMS ARISE WITH
THE CONSTANT, TIRING USE OF MICROFICHE.
