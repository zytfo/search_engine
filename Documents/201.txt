PHILOSOPHER AND LIBRARIAN SIDE BY SIDE.

THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP REVEALS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS WHO
HAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN AND
THE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOST
STRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. IN
ADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THE
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF BOTH LIBRARIAN AND PHILOSOPHER IS ONLY ACQUIRED
AFTER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. BOTH GROUPS SEEK TO CREATE ORDER IN THE MATERIAL
WHICH FORMS THE FOCUS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ALTHOUGH NOT INNOVATORS
THEMSELVES, WILLINGLY OFFER THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.
