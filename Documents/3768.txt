LIBRARY MANUAL FOR HEALTH PLANNING AGENCIES.
     
THIS LIBRARY MANUAL FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS AGENCIES, AND OTHER SMALL
HEALTH-ORIENTED LIBRARIES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE EFFORT BY
PACT HEALTH PLANNING CENTER AND THE DHEW REGION 8 LIBRARY. IT IS HOPED THAT
THIS MANUAL WILL NOT ONLY EXPLAIN THE SYSTEMATIC USE AND ORGANISATION OF A
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM BUT ALSO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A
SYSTEM IN ALL REGION 8 AGENCIES.
