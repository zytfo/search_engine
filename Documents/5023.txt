GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY RESOURCES.

EXTRACT FROM RECENT TRENDS IN RESOURCE ACQUISITION IN AUSTRALIAN ACADEMIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES, A PAPER PRESENTED BY G.G. ALLEN AND J.R. BROCKMAN AT THE
47TH IFLA CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG, AUG 81. TABULATES AND DISCUSSES THE
DISTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES BY STATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NATIONAL
RESOURCES, DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, AND LIBRARY BOOKS/INHABITANT (ALL
1933-79). RESOURCES ARE FAR FROM EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE MAJOR POPULATION
CENTRES; CANBERRA IS PARTICULARLY WELL SERVED; AND VICTORIA (2ND MOST POPULOUS
STATE AND CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA'S ESTABLISHMENT AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY) IS
SURPRISINGLY BADLY SERVED.
