THE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, CONTRIBUTE ROUGHLY 6% OF
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S POPULATION. TO THIS END, THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AT POPRAD,
(SLOVAKIA), HELD IN MAY 81 DEALT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE LECTURES GIVEN SHOWED A GOOD THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
VERY OFTEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THE
HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED. LIBRARIANS CAN INFLUENCE THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S
ATTITUDE TO THEIR HANDICAPPED FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS
MADE SOME USEFUL SUGGESTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ADJUSTMENT OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT FOR
THE HANDICAPPED, DEVELOPMENT OF READING AIDS FOR BEDRIDDEN PEOPLE AND THE
LIKE, AND THERE WAS ALSO AN APPEAL TO THE PRESS FOR FULL COVERAGE OF THESE AND
MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING THE HANDICAPPED IN THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF
THE DISABLED.
