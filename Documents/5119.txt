HOW CAN YOUR SON BECOME A READER?.

THE MOSCOW AND TUL'SK PAEDAGOGIC INSTITUTES RECENTLY INVESTIGATED
SCHOOLCHILDREN'S WANING INTEREST IN FICTION AND FOUND ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLCHILDREN READ LITTLE AND WERE INDIFFERENT TO FICTION. THE
EXTRA-CURRICULAR READING PROJECT FOR 1ST TO 3RD FORMS EVOLVED. HERE CHILDREN
LEARN TO EXAMINE BOOKS CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING ON SELECTION. AFTER 6 MONTHS
OF THIS INSTRUCTION, 65% OF 1ST-FORMERS WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO FIND THE BOOKS
REQUIRED. THE METHOD IS SUPPLEMENTED BY READING ALOUD STORIES ABOUT THE TEXT,
LITERARY GAMES, COMPETITIONS, ETC. THE AIM IS TO FAMILIARISE 1ST TO
3RD-FORMERS WITH SOME OF THE BEST RUSSIAN, SOVIET AND FOREIGN LITERATURE.
LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONSOLIDATE ON THESE EARLIEST SCHOOL READING HABITS. SCHOOL
LIBRARY COORDINATION IS NECESSARY.
