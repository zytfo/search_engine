RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IS THE NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTRE IN
THE FIELD OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT IN CLOSE
COOPERATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA, AS WELL AS REGIONAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES AND SOME MAJOR LIBRARIES IN THE USSR. ALTHOUGH THE RESEARCH PROJECTS
PLANNED FOR THE 8TH 5-YEAR PLAN (1981-85) ARE STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC THEY ARE NOT
OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY. ALL TYPES OF THE COUNTRY'S LIBRARIES AND, INDEED,
THE LIBRARY NETWORK AS A WHOLE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESULTS. THE ISSUES UNDER
INVESTIGATION INCLUDE PROPAGANDA OF LITERATURE, GUIDED READING, OPEN ACCESS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES, NEW SUBJECT CATALOGUES, LIBRARY
SERVICES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS, RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF SPECIALISED BOOK COLLECTIONS TO PARTICULAR TYPES OF LIBRARY.
