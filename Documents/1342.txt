TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR PARTIAL U.S.
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.

LIBRARY LITERATURE HAS LONG IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT FOR
U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES ARE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED
BY THIS OVERSIGHT. HOWEVER, THE PARTIAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SUFFERS THE
CONSEQUENCES. OFTEN IN THE PAST, THE SOLE CRITERION FOR THE BUILDING OF A
PARTIAL DEPISITORY COLLECTION HAS BEEN ACCRETION WITHOUT REGARD FOR OTHER
SALIENT FACTORS. AT PRESENT AND IN THE FORESEABLE FUTURE, FISCAL EXIGENCY WILL
CAUSE INCREASING DEMANDS TO BE MADE ON THE LIBRARY'S BUDGET AND SPACE. IN
ORDER TO MAKE JUDICIOUS DECISIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE DEPOTISORY COLLECTION
TO GROW IN A MANNER RESPONSIVE TO ITS OWN NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO VARIOUS
CURRICULAR AND COMMUNITY NEEDS, A FRAMEWORK OF POLICY MUST EXIST. IT IS IN
THIS CONTEXT THAT A POLICY STATEMENT IS PRESENTED.
