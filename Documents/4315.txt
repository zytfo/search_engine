ON THE INTERLIBRARY LOAN MAP.
     
IN QUESTIONNAIRE REPLIES, FEW READERS AT THE OPOCHKA REGIONAL LIBRARY KNEW OF
THE INTERLIBRARY LOANS SYSTEM, (ILS). THE REGIONAL LIBRARY'S DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE BIBLIOGRAPHERS PRODUCE INFORMATION LISTS ON NEW
ACCESSIONS, SO THE REASON CANNOT BE LACK OF INFORMATION ON AGRICULTURAL
PUBLICATIONS. INDIVIDUAL WORK WITH READERS IS NECESSARY TO DISCOVER THEIR TRUE
REQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME LIBRARIES CONSIDER THE ILS AN OPTIONAL
BURDEN. UNDER ILS RULES FICTION AND EDUCATIONAL BOOKS ARE DISPATCHED ONLY FOR
SCIENTIFIC AND PRODUCTIVE WORK. PROBLEMS ARISE IN DEFINING 'EDUCATIONAL'
BOOKS. FROM JULY 81 A STATE STANDARD WILL APPEAR CONCERNING A UNIFIED ILS AND
INTRODUCING CERTAIN CHANGES.
