THE WORK MARKET.
     
ARGUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAT WILL
TRULY PREPARE THE PROFESSIONAL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A WORK MARKET DETERMINED,
IN BRAZIL, BY THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS NOW AN
INCREASING DEMAND FOR LIBRARIANS, BUT LIBRARY SCHOOLS DO NOT GEAR THEIR
PROGRAMMES TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR ACTUAL SOCIAL SITUATIONS. ONCE THE NATURE
OF THE MARKET NEEDS IS UNDERSTOOD, TRAINING POLICIES CAN BE ADAPTED
ACCORDINGLY. ILLUSTRATES THE ARGUMENT WITH REFERENCE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FIELDS, EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY FOR PRACTICAL ABILITIES
AND PROFESSIONAL AWARENESS.
