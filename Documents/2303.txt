THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER EDUCATION IN GHANA.
     
(PHD THESIS). IN GHANA, THERE IS A POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE INFORMATION
PROBLEM, BUT USER EDUCATION IS NOT PURSUED WITH SIMILAR ENTHUSIASM. EXAMINES
THE PRESENT USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES/ACTIVITIES IN GHANAIAN EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING THE
CONSTRAINTS WHICH AFFECT SUCH PROGRAMMES. MAKES PROPOSALS FOR A BASIC
INFRA-STRUCTURE, THE REVISION OF PRESENT PROGRAMMES WHERE NEEDED, AND A
CAREFULLY-DESIGNED APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY FOR EACH CATEGORY OF USER.
