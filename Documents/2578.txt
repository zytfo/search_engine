THE PEOPLE WANT PAP, OR IDEAS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF LIBRARY WORK.
     
A YOUNG LIBRARIAN CHALLENGES HIS COLLEAGUES TO QUESTION THE ATTITUDE THAT THEY
HAVE HELD TOWARDS THEIR WORK UNTIL NOW. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE AT PRESENT IN A
BLIND ALLEY. LIBRARIANS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BOOKS ARE NOT SIMPLY THE SOURCES
OF CERTAIN IDEAS' THEY ARE ALSO GOODS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF MARKETING, HENCE
THE PREDOMINANCE OF BEST-SELLERS AND TRIVIAL MATERIAL ON THE MARKET. IT IS
WRONG TO VALUE THE ABILITY TO READ ABOVE THAT OF PLAYING FOOTBALL; WHAT IS
VITAL IS DISCRIMINATION AND SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF THE
MATERIAL READ. LIBRARIANS ARE AFTER ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR ACTUAL AND
POTENTIAL READERS, BY WHOM THEIR WORK IS FINANCED.
