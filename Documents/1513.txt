THE TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT: AN ATTEMPT AT 'ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION'.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. AN ACCOUNT OF THE BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH A
NON-TRADITIONAL STRATEGY OF EVALUATION WAS ADOPTED IN NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE
POLYTECHNIC'S TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT (SEE 77/3731). THE CLEAR-CUT
DISTINCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS OF
THE EVALUATION BECAME BLURRED AND THERE WAS CONFLICT BETWEEN PRESSURES FOR A
TRADITIONAL, TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED EVALUATION AND THE RESEARCHERS' PREFERENCE FOR
A MORE EXPLANATORY EVALUATION STRATEGY. ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION WAS USED; THIS
ESCHEWS PRE- AND POST-TESTING IN FAVOUR OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THE
CONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS OF A VENTURE'S SUCCESS. ITS USE POSES MANY PROBLEMS
BECAUSE IT IS A BROAD STRATEGY RATHER THAN A SET OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES.
