LIBRARY PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGHT PROBLEMS IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GERMAN CENTRAL
LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND IN LEIPZIG.

THE LIBRARY, FOUNDED IN 1894, HAS TAKEN OVER ALL SELECTION, PRODUCTION,
PRESENTATION AND SALES OF LITERATURE FOR THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED IN
EAST GERMANY. LOAN STOCKS INCLUDE ABOUT 7,000 BOOKS AND 6,000 SCORES IN
BRAILLE AND OVER 3,000 TALKING BOOKS. MORE THAN 1,000 TITLES ARE AVAILABLE FOR
SALE. GENERALLY USERS PREFER NON-FICTION IN BRAILLE AND FICTION ON TAPE OR
CASSETTE. MANY OF THE 2,000 REGULAR USERS BECOME BLIND WHEN ELDERLY, SO THEY
PREFER TALKING BOOKS TO BRAILLE. MONTHLY LISTS OF NEW ADDITIONS TO STOCK ARE
PUBLISHED. INFORMATION ON NEW CHILDREN'S BOOKS IS SENT TO PARENTS AND
INFORMATION ON LARGE PRINT BOOKS TO LIBRARIES AND OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS MAINTAINED WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS IN THIS FIELD, ESPECIALLY
WITH SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND AND MUCH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED FOR SERVICES IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
