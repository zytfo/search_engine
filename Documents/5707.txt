FAIR PLAY WITH THE CAKE, YOU KNOW?'.D

ISCUSSES THE ECONOMIC CUTS AS THEY AFFECT THE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE
GOVERNMENT'S SAVINGS CIRCULAR RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CUT LIBRARY
EXPENDITURE TO 185 KR PER CAPITA, AS, IT WAS ARGUED, PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOWED
SIGNS OF UNCONTROLLED GROWTH. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS, HOWEVER, CALCULATED
PUBLIC LIBRARIES' REAL GROWTH IN 1980 AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDED
3%; THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE. THE FIGURES FOR 1981
INDICATE AN AVERAGE FALL IN REAL GROWTH OF 1.4%. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS
EXAMINED THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF CUTS AND FOUND THAT FRINGE SERVICES LIKE
OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE WORST HIT AND THAT STAFF APPOINTMENTS ARE FROZEN. THE
GOVERNMENT'S TECHNOCRATS HAVE DRAWN UP MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PUBLIC SECTOR, BUT LIBRARIANS' ANSWER MUST BE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
LIBRARY PART OF THIS SECTOR IS NOT A TECHNICAL MATTER ONLY, BUT THAT CULTURAL
ASPECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.
