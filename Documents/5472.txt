SO WHO SUPPORTS THIRD LANARK NOW?.

COMPARES THE SCOTTISH LIBRARIES/BOOK TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD LANARK
VOLUNTEER RESERVES, WHO BECAME ONE OF SCOTLAND'S BEST KNOWN AND BEST LOVED
FOOTBALL TEAMS, YET STILL DISAPPEARED FOR EVER. IN 1980, SCOTTISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES SPENT APPROXIMATELY *64.5 MILLION ON BOOKS, 52% OF WHICH WAS SPENT
OUTSIDE SCOTLAND. EXPLAINS WHY THE SCOTTISH BOOK TRADE NEEDS THE LIBRARIES'
CUSTOM TO SURVIVE, WHY THE LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEIR PUBLIC TO
ORDER FROM THEIR NATIVE BOOK TRADE, AND HOW THE LIBRARIES AND BOOK TRADE
TOGETHER CAN MAKE A BASIC CONTRIBUTION TO SCOTTISH CULTURE.
