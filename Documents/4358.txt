A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THESAURI AND NORMALISED
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGIES WITH THE AIM OF THEIR COORDINATED
DEVELOPMENT.
     
ANALYSES THE SPECIFICS AND RESULTS OF THE LEXICAL PROCESSING OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL TEXTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF THESAURI FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
ACTIVITIES AND FOR THE UNIFICATION OF TERMINOLOGY. IDENTIFIES METHODS FOR
REPRESENTING THE MEANINGS OF TERMS IN THESAURI AND TERMINOLOGICAL SYSTEMS.
PROPOSES PROCEDURES FOR THE CORRELATION OF THESAURI CONSTRUCTION AND
MAINTENANCE WITH TERMINOLOGICAL WORK, AND THE SIMULTANEOUS SOLUTION OF THE
PROBLEMS OF THE 2 DISCIPLINES.
