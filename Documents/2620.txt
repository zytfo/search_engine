LIBRARY SERVICES FOR FOREIGN RESIDENTS.
     
FOREIGN WORKERS HAVE MADE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS WEST GERMAN
PROSPERITY BUT OUR SOCIETY IS ILL PREPARED FOR THE ACUTENESS OF THE PROBLEMS
FACING FOREIGN CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THEIR EDUCATIONAL DEPRIVATION IS
GROUNDED ABOVE ALL IN THEIR INFERIOR SOCIAL POSITION. FOREIGN CHILDREN SHOULD
EXPERIENCE A SOCIALISATION PROCESS WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE INTEGRATED
INTO GERMAN SOCIETY AND RE-INTEGRATED INTO THE SOCIETY OF THEIR NATIVE LAND,
FOR WHICH THEY MUST GROW UP TO BE BOTH BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL. THE LIBRARY
SHOULD BE THE FOREIGN CITIZENS' CENTRE FOR INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND
CULTURE. BILATERAL LITERATURE PROVISION, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE. BILATERAL
LITERATURE PROVISION HELPS FOREIGN CITIZENS TO BECOME CODETERMINING, ACTIVE
AND CREATIVE WITHIN OUR PLURALISTIC CULTURE. GOOD LIBRARY SERVICES
COMPLEMENTING GOOD SCHOOLING ARE AN INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE.
