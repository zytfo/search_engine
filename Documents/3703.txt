LIBRARY PLANNING FOR FUTURE NETWORKS.
     
AUTOMATION DEVELOPMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ARE VIEWED AS LEADING TOWARD
INVOLVEMENT IN NETWORKS. THE PRIMARY ISSUES OF MACHINE-READABLE RECORD
FORMATS, HOLDINGS FORMATS MECHANISMS FOR UPDATING MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASES,
AND SYSTEM INTERFACES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPERATING SYSTEMS NEED TO BE
ADDRESSED IF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TO BE A STEP TOWARD THE LIBRARY'S
EVENTUAL NETWORKING CAPABILITIES. LIBRARIES AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS ARE
ALL PROGRESSING IN THEIR USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, BUT NOT NECESSARILY
TOWARD A COMMON GOAL.
