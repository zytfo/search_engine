TRAINING OF MIDDLE-GRADE HEALTH WORKERS IN THE UTILISATION OF MEDICAL
INFORMATION.
     
INFORMATION TRAINING FOR MIDDLE-GRADE HEALTH WORKERS IS COMING MORE AND MORE
INTO THE LIMELIGHT. 28 HEAD NURSES WORKING IN HUNGARIAN HOSPITALS AND
OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENTS WERE INTERVIEWED AS WAS THE HEAD OF NURSES' EXTENSION
TRAINING IN THE COUNTY HEALTH ORGANISATION CENTRE. ALL AGREED THAT NURSES
NEEDED TO STUDY MEDICAL LITERATURE. SUGGESTS 3 HOURS OF INFORMATION TRAINING
FOR THE MIDDLE-GRADE WORKERS WITH A FURTHER HOUR FOR PRACTICE.
