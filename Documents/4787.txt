BI FOR THE INVISIBLE UNIVERSITY.
     
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT, IN THE USA, 90% OF ALL ADULTS ENGAGE IN SOME
KIND OF LEARNING ACTIVITY AND 73% OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SELF-GUIDED. ALTHOUGH
NOT AFFILIATED TO AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION THESE STUDENTS FORM PART
OF AN 'INVISIBLE UNIVERSITY'. THE NEED FOR SOME SORT OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION BY
THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS IS DISCUSSED.
