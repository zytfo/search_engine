AN ASSOCIATIVE INTERACTIVE DICTIONARY FOR ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING.
     
A PROTOTYPE ASSOCIATIVE INTERACTIVE DICTIONARY (AID) SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED
TO ASSIST IN SEARCH STRATEGY FORMULATION ON A LARGE OPERATIONAL FREE-TEXT
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEM. THE PRIMARY DESIGN OBJECTIVE IS THE
AUTOMATIC GENERATION AND DISPLAY OF RELATED TERMS, BROADER AND NARROWER TERMS,
AND OTHER SEMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS FOR GIVEN SEARCH CONCEPTS. THE ASSOCIATIVE
TEXT ANALYSIS PROCEDURES RELY ON STATISTICAL FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
INFORMATION ABOUT TERM OCCURRENCES IN THE DATA BASE AND IN RETRIEVED SETS OF
DOCUMENTS.
