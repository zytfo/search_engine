THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (II)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, BIELEFELD, OCT 80.
(FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDS
FOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE
LIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY AND
MOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTH
QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
LIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIA
THEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARY
CAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUM
STANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.
