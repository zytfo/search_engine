THE NEED FOR READING ROOMS.

IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIKE PAPUA NEW GUINEA, MOST PEOPLE LIVE IN RURAL AREAS
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, OR STUDY FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN THEIR HOMES.
THOSE WHO HAVE SUCH FACILITIES ARE OFTEN SURROUNDED BY DISTRACTIONS AT HOME.
READING ROOMS ARE VITAL IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PERSON
WITH NO HOME STUDY FACILITIES. THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE LIBRARY BUILDING,
BUT OUTSIDE THE MAIN LIBRARY ITSELF, AND OFTEN AFTER LIBRARY HOURS.
