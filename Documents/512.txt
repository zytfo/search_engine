THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE. PART 3. QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS'
OBJECTIVE MAPS AND SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPES.

THE METRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION SPACE ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
PHYSICAL SPACE. AN ABSTRACT MODEL IS USED TO SHOW THAT INFORMATION SPACE IS
LIKE THAT OF LANDSCAPES AND SKYSCRAPERS. AS INDIVIDUALS WE LEARN VERY EARLY TO
CORRECT THE DISTORTIONS THAT SUBJECTIVE APPEARANCES IMPOSE ON US BUT TRACES OF
THIS PROCESS ARE SHOWN BY COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE SUPPORTED
BY OTHER EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT INFORMATION QUANTITIES SHOULD BE MEASURED
LOGARITHMICALLY. FOR PARTS 1 AND 2 SEE 81/1828 AND 81/1829. FOR PART 4 SEE THE
