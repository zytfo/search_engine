THE LIBRARY-BOOKSTORE.

BOTH LIBRARY AND BOOKSHOP EXIST TO BRING TOGETHER BOOK (OR OTHER MATERIAL) AND
READER. OCCASIONALLY A LIBRARIAN PERCEIVES OR ESTABLISHES A COMBINED ENTITY, A
LIBRARY AND BOOKSHOP WHICH WORK IN PARTNERSHIP. DESCRIBES EXPERIMENTS,
PARTICULARLY IN US UNIVERSITIES, IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE INCORPORATED OR BEEN
SITED NEXT TO BOOKSHOPS, RESULTING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CUTTING DOWN THE SIZE
OF THE LIBRARY'S COSTLY AND UNWIELDY RESERVE COLLECTIONS, AND ALLOWING THE
LIBRARY TO STOCK ONLY A SMALL COLLECTION OF OUT-OF-PRINT BOOKS WHICH COULD BE
COPIED FOR SALE.
