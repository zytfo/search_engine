THE ART OF RUNNING A DATA LIBRARY.
     
DATA TECHNOLOGY HAS APPEARED AT THE RIGHT TIME TO HELP LIBRARIANS WITH THE
GREATLY INCREASED WORKLOAD OF RECENT YEARS. RETROSPECTIVE LITERATURE SEARCHING
AND CURRENT LITERATURE AWARENESS, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BENEFIT GREATLY FROM
AUTOMATION. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE LIKELY IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL AND
COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES, FULLER INDEXING TO AID IDENTIFICATION IN THE
HUMANITIES, CATALOGUING OF LOCAL COLLECTIONS, AND INDEXING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD SET ABOUT INFORMING STAFF AND PUBLIC ON
THE QUESTION OF COMPUTERISATION; THE WORKING PARTY RECENTLY APPOINTED SHOULD
INTENSIFY THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON THE SWEDISH BUMS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND
AUTOMATION IN GENERAL; AND CONTACTS SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ETWEEN CULTURAL AND
LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO DISCUSSING AUTOMATION IN SWEDISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
