A COMPARISON OF OVERLAP: ERIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS.

IN NOV 78, THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA EDUCATION LIBRARY INVESTIGATED THE
OVERLAP OF THE ERIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS ON-LINE DATA BASES, PERFORMING
THE SAME 4 SEARCHES ON BOTH. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS AND SUGGESTS THAT WHEN
BUDGET RESTRICTIONS FORCE A CHOICE TO BE MADE BETWEEN THE 2, THE SEARCHER
SHOULD' CONSIDER THE END USER'S DISCIPLINE-EDUCATION OR PSYCHOLOGY; USE ERIC
FOR TOPICS DEALING WITH THE 'NORMAL' POPULATION, PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, AND
APPLIED SETTINGS; USE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS FOR MATERIAL ON 'ABNORMAL' OR
'DISTURBED' POPULATIONS, CLINICAL SETTINGS, AND NON-US TOPICS; REMEMBER THAT
ERIC IS EASIER TO SEARCH MANUALLY THAN THE OTHER; AND CONSIDER THEIR
NON-JOURNAL COVERAGE.
