THE UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY: LAMONT AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

THIS REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES, THE HISTORICAL
CONTEXT FROM WHICH THEY AROSE, AND THEIR STATUS AT THE END OF THE 70S POINTS
OUT THAT A LONG TRADITION OF LACK OF CONCERN FOR UNDERGRADUATE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
NEEDS WAS BROKEN DRAMATICALLY IN 1949 BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAMONT LIBRARY,
THE HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE FACILITY. ALTHOUGH DESIGNED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS UNIQUE
TO HARVARD, LAMONT WAS AN EXEMPLARY CONSTRUCTION THAT SOON CAPTURED THE
IMAGINATION OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WORLD. IT BECAME THE MODEL FOR A RASH OF
NEW LIBRARIES AIMED AT SATISFYING 'UNIQUE' UNDERGRADUATE NEEDS. THESE
LIBRARIES PROLIFERATED DURING THE 50S AND 60S, A PERIOD OF ACCELERATED GROWTH
IN ACADEME. BY THE 70S, HOWEVER, THE GENERAL FINANCIAL RETRENCHMENT OF
AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAD VIRTUALLY HALTED NEW CONSTRUCTION.
FURTHER, THE THESIS THAT PRESUMED THE NEEDS OF UNDERGRADUATES TO BE SOMEHOW
'DIFFERENT', AS WELL AS THE ADVISABI LITY OF FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY
SEGREGATING THEM FROM THE REST OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, CAME UNDER ATTACK IN
THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. FEW UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES WERE BUILT DURING
THIS PERIOD AND SEVERAL WERE CLOSED OR CONVERTED TO OTHER USES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
