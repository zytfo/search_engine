BULGARIA AS DEPICTED IN OLD MAPS.
     
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY AND
THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, ALL IN SOFIA, AND THE IVAN VAZOV NATIONAL LIBRARY IN
PLOVDIV HAVE THE LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF MAPS AND ATLASES IN BULGARIA. COVERS
ONLY MAPS ISSUED UP TO 1944, IN WHICH BULGARIA IS INCLUDED. THE OLDEST OF THEM
ARE NOT VERY ELABORATE, WITH TEXT IN LATIN ONLY. FROM THE 16TH CENTURY,
PARALLEL TEXT IN GERMAN AND/OR FRENCH WAS ADDED. UP TO THE 18TH CENTURY, THE
MAPS WERE PRINTED AND PUBLISHED MAINLY IN AMSTERDAM, ROME, AUSBURG AND
NUERBURG, BULGARIA'S OWN CARTOGRAPHIC FACILITIES STARTED WITH THE FIRST MAP
PRODUCED BY A BULGARIAN IN BULGARIAN WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1843. EVEN THEN,
HOWEVER, MAPS WERE PRINTED IN VIENNA. ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WAS THE LIBERATION
FROM TURKISH RULE (1878), FOLLOWED BY THE FOUNDATION OF VARIOUS NATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS, HEADED BY THE STATE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE (1891) AND
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA (1898) WITH THE CHAIR OF GEOGRAPHY . THERE WERE ALSO
HISTORIC MAPS PUBLISHED FROM 1878 TO 1944. AMONG THEM, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS
THE MAP OF UPRISING AND CLASS STRUGGLE, AIMING TOWARDS AND EVENTUALLY LEADING
TO THE LIBERATION AND UNIFICATION OF THE BULGARIAN NATION.
