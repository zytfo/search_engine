ORIGINALLY PRESENTED AT THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDICAL
LIBRARIANSHIP HELD IN BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA, 2-5 SEPT 80. ON-LINE LITERATURE
RETRIEVAL SERVICES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN JAPAN ARE JOIS, TOOL-IR, IDEAS/77,
DIALOG, AND ORBIT. GENERAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LITERATURE RETRIEVAL
SERVICES ARE: (1) DATA BASES DO NOT COVER CERTAIN PRIMARY SOURCES; (2)
SECONDARY SOURCES IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SUCH AS IGAKU CHUO ZASSHI AND BERICHITE
& ZENTRALBLATTER ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON-LINE; (3) INDEXING OF INFORMATION IS NOT
EXCLUSIVE, EVEN IF THE PRIMARY SOURCE IS COVERED BY THE DATA BASE. IN ORDER TO
COMPENSATE FOR THESE PROBLEMS, THE NIPPON MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PRODUCES
INDEX CARDS FOR SPECIAL FEATURE ARTICLES WHICH ARE NOT EASILY RETRIEVED,
SYNDROMES OF DISEASES, AND MEETINGS HELD BY SOCIETIES WITHOUT OFFICIAL
PUBLICATIONS.
