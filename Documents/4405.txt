PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK,
22-25 SEPT 81. MODERN AIDS TO TRANSLATION SUCH AS WORD PROCESSORS,
TELECOPIERS, DICTATION EQUIPMENT AND OPTICAL CHARACTER READERS ARE EXAMINED.
THE TRANSLATION PROCESS IS BROKEN DOWN WITH EXAMPLES, TO ESTABLISH WHICH
COMPONENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE AT MODERATE COST. PRODUCTION
TIME FOR SUPPORTED AND SOLITARY TRANSLATORS IS COMPARED TO ESTABLISH POSSIBLE
TIME SAVING AREAS. MANUAL TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY TRANSLATOR OR SECRETARY GAIN
MOST FROM MECHANISATION BUT INFORMATION SEARCH IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT AREA FOR
SAVINGS.
