UNIQUE SERIAL TITLE ENTRIES.

AACR 2 REQUIRES A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF PERIODICALS TO BE ENTERED UNDER
TITLE, WHETHER OR NOT THE TITLE IS UNIQUE. THE CODE DOES NOT PROVIDE RULES FOR
THE CREATION OF UNIFORM TITLES FOR PERIODICALS. AS A RESULT, THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS DREW UP GUIDELINES FOR UNIFORM TITLES.
