REGISTRATION-IDENTIFICATION OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS BASED ON LATTICE AND
EMPIRICAL FORMULA.

DATA FILES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON SOLID-STATE MATERIALS ARE EXPANDING
RAPIDLY. EACH YEAR SEVERAL THOUSAND NEW MATERIALS ARE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY
DIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPUTER PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
TO REGISTER MATERIALS ENTERING LARGE DATA FILES. REGISTRATION BASED ON LATTICE
PARAMETERS AND EMPIRICAL FORMULA IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE. THE LATTICE IS
UNIQUELY REPRESENTED BY THE REDUCED CELL AND THE ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULA ARE
UNIQUELY SPECIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR SEVERAL
YEARS TO REGISTER NEW MATERIALS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA FILE
WHICH CONTAINS DATA ON MORE THAN 25,000 COMPOUNDS CONTAINING ORGANIC CARBON.
THE METHOD IS NOW BEING ADAPTED TO REGISTER MATERIALS FOR THE NBS CRYSTAL DATA
FILE.
