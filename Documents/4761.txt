A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1981 INTERAMERICAN CONFERENCE OF AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS. BRAZIL, LIKE OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, IS
LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SUPPLIES, DERIVED FROM NATURAL RESOURCES,
EXPLOITED BY AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. CONSIDERS THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES IN SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FIELD, DESCRIBING
THE KIND OF RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED AND THE SERVICES REQUIRED. PRESENTS
A MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICE WITHIN A
RESEARCH INSTITUTION, WITH DETAILS OF THE ACTIVITIES ESSENTIAL FOR INFORMATION
ACQUISITION, PROCESSING AND DISSEMINATION; USER SERVICES; AND SUPPORT SERVICES
FOR THE PARENT INSTITUTION; SHOWING HOW THE STRUCTURE CAN BE MODIFIED FOR
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS. IN CONCLUSION, EMPHASISES THAT AGRO-INDUSTRIAL
INFORMATION IS A NEW FIELD WITH ITS OWN SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS.
