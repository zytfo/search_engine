EDUCATION OF INFORMATION USERS IN AGRICULTURE.
     
IT IS NOW COMMONPLACE THAT THE GROWTH OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS SUCH THAT NO
INDIVIDUAL CAN READ ALL RELEVANT MATERIAL. INSTRUCTING AND TRAINING
UNDERGRADUATES IN MAKING USE OF LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL
AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, FIRSTLY AT THE RELEVANT ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGHER
EDUCATION AND LATER ON IN THEIR WORKING PLACE, IS THEREFORE OF THE HIGHEST
SIGNIFICANCE. FOR GREATER EFFECT, TRAINING SHOULD BEGIN DURING COMPULSORY
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. SINCE 1977, THE SCHOOL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND VETERINARY
MEDICINE AT STARA ZAGORA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THIS FIELD. IT IS
HOPED THAT NATIONAL SYLLABUSES WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
