QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY DIDACTICS.
     
THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL LIBRARY AT KASSEL-WALDAU, WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLIC
LIBRARY, IS A PILOT PROJECT IN THE KASSEL AREA. INSTRUCTION IN LIBRARY USE IS
PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM. INTRODUCTORY TALKS ARE GIVEN IN THE CLASSROOMS
BY TEACHERS, AFTER WHICH THE LIBRARIAN PROVIDES ABOUT 10 HOURS OF BASIC
INSTRUCTION IN THE LIBRARY ON MEDIA, USE OF CATALOGUES AND LIBRARY PROCEDURES.
THEN CHILDREN WORK IN THE LIBRARY, FINDING MATERIAL ON SUBJECTS OF INTEREST
AND PREPARING LITTLE TALKS ON THEM. LIBRARIAN AND TEACHERS ADVISE ON CHOICE OF
MATERIAL AND THE BEST WAYS OF EXTRACTING INFORMATION. CLOSE COOPERATION
BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND TEACHERS IS ESSENTIAL. TEACHERS RECEIVE INSTRUCTION ON
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AT REGIONAL ADVANCED TRAINING CONFERENCES.
