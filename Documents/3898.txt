GRAPH POTENTIALS METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION FOR CHEMICAL INFORMATION
PROCESSING.
     
A GRAPH POTENTIALS METHOD FOR THE SOLUTION OF ISOMORPHISM AND AUTOMORPISM
PARTITIONING PROBLEMS IS PROPOSED. THE METHOD IS BASED ON AN ANALOGY BETWEEN
GRAPHS AND ELECTRICAL NETWORKS AND SERVES TO COMPUTE GRAPH INVARIANTS,
INCLUDING VERTEX POTENTIALS AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS AND TO PROVIDE AN
EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS. SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATING
SENSITIVITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ARE PRESENTED.
