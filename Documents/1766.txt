THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL OF INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEMS WHEN COMBINED WITH
EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY-SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.
     
SOME POTENTIALITIES FOR THE USE OF ADVANCED INTEGRATED INFORMATION/LEARNING
SYSTEMS IN THE STUDY OF THE INTER-RELATED ROLE OF HITHERTO RELATIVELY
INTRACTABLE COMPLEX VARIABLES SUCH AS COGNITIVE MAPPING BEHAVIOURS, LEARNING
STYLES, AND THE MEDIA PREFERENCES OF INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS, ARE DESCRIBED,
WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH RESEARCH
EXPLORATIONS IN THE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED AND LESS ADVANCED NATIONS.
