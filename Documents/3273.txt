COMPUTER-AIDED SELECTION OF COMPOUNDS FOR ANTITUMOR SCREENING' VALIDATION OF A
STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD.
     
RECENT WORK HELPED CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED
STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD FOR SELECTING COMPOUNDS TO BE PROCESSED IN THE
NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) MOUSE TUMOUR PRESCREEN. ONE STUDY INVOLVED
ABOUT 35,000 COMPOUNDS WHICH SATISFIED CERTAIN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL
CRITERIA. THESE COMPOUNDS, TAKEN FROM THE NCI COLLECTION, WERE RANKED
ACCORDING TO PREDICTED PROBABILITY OF ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS SHOWED 34% OF THE
ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN THE TOP 10% OF THE RANKING. IN A SECOND STUDY THE
PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF A CHEMIST AND THE COMPUTER WERE COMPARED BY HAVING EACH
RATE ALMOST 1,000 PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED COMPOUNDS FOR ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS
WERE ABOUT EQUAL WITH RESPECT TO THE YIELD OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS,
THOUGH THEIR SELECTION AGREEMENT WAS FAIRLY LOW.
