ON SOME THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY WITHIN
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY IN LIBRARY SCIENCE.
     
SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DIVIDED INTO 7 THEMATIC GROUPS' THEORETICAL
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; ORGANISATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
LITERATURE INFORMATION AND METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACTIVITY; HISTORIC
DEVELOPMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT
LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF RECOMMENDATORY BIBLIOGRAPHY
IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR; AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY. THESE 7 THEMES
ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND INTERSECT IN MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY, WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES OTHER THEMES. THE COURSE
IN BIBLIOGRAPHY IS A BALANCED MIXTURE OF THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE EDUCATED TO THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF BIBLIOGRAPHY AS IT
EXISTS IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR. THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE COURSE IS NOT
ADEQUATE AND STUDENTS HAVE TO STUDY INDEPENDEN TLY WHICH REQUIRES A GOOD
KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES AS MUCH OF THE COURSE LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN AND
ENGLISH.
