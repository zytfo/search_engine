DEVELOPMENT OF A FORMAT FOR ABSTRACTING DOSE-RESPONSE INFORMATION FROM
PUBLISHED STUDIES FOR USE IN QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS
(QSARS).

THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT SUBJECTS SOME 70,000 CHEMICALS TO REGULATORY
ACTION. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THIS NUMBER
OF COMPOUNDS IS NOT FEASIBLE. AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
PREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE POTENCY OF AN
UNTESTED COMPOUND TOWARD A SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL RECEPTOR. PREREQUISITE TO SUCH
AN ENTERPRISE IS THE HIGHLY SYSTEMATIC COMPILATION OF DOSE-RESPONSE
INFORMATION FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL END POINTS AND FOR A WIDE VARIETY
OF MOLECULAR SPECIES. A FORMAT IS DESCRIBED FOR ABSTRACTING RELEVANT
INFORMATION FROM PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE FORMAT OUTLINES THE TEST SYSTEM,
EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, RESPONSE ANALYSIS, EXPOSURE PROTOCOL, AND RESULTS AND
PRESENTS THE ORIGINAL DATA, ALL IN AN ORGANISED FORM. REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS
USED TO ESTIMATE THRES HOLDS AND POTENCIES IN THE VARIOUS TEST SYSTEMS. THE
DATA MAY THEN BE USED TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY.
