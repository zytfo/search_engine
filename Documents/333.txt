THE TERMINAL QUESTION FOR WHOLESALERS AND THE BALANCE OF TRADE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH SOME WHOLESALERS ARE
WELL AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE CANADIAN BOOK DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IN APPLYING
NEW TECHNOLOGY, THEY MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR APPROACH IF THE DISTRIBUTION
PROCESS IS TO BE AUTOMATED. US AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ARE GEARED TO FAST SERVICE
FROM A NATION-WIDE WHOLESALE CHAIN. CANADA HAS NO SUCH CHAIN AND WHOLESALERS
MAY HAVE TO FORM A CONSORTIUM. A CENTRAL COORDINATING AGENCY HAS BEEN
SUGGESTED IN A STUDY BY PEAT, MARWICK AND MCCARTHY & MCCARTHY. MANY FEEL THE
NEED FOR BETTER STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY IN THE USE OF ISBNS. IF CANADIAN
WHOLESALERS DO NOT ACT QUICKLY, US WHOLESALERS WILL TAKE OVER.
