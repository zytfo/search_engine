THE AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF LITERATURE ABSTRACTS: AN APPROACH BASED ON THE
IDENTIFICATION OF SELF-INDICATING PHRASES.
     
PRESENTS A METHOD FOR THE AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF INDICATIVE ABSTRACTS BASED
ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMMONLY-OCCURRING STRUCTURES WHICH EXPLICITLY STATE
THAT THE SENTENCES CONTAINING THEM HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY ABOUT THE
SUBJECT MATTER OR 'MESSAGE' OF THE DOCUMENT. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STRUCTURES OR
'INDICATORS' ARE 'THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THIS PAPER...' AND 'A METHOD IS
DESCRIBED FOR...'. DISCUSSES THE IDENTIFICATION AND WEIGHTING OF INDICATORS;
ADDITION OF SUPPORTIVE SENTENCES; AND TREATMENT OF EXOPHORIC FEATURES. THE
RESULTS OF A TEST RUN AIMING AT 105-WORD ABSTRACTS WERE PROMISING.
