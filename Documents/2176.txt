REGIONAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARIANSHIP' A STATEMENT OF THE SITUATION.
     
BASIC PROBLEMS IN REGIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND USED AS
SUBJECTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THEY INCLUDE' (1) REGIONAL PECULIARITIES
REGARDING THE DISPERSAL AND USAGE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES; (2) THE NEED FOR MORE
RATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN LIBRARY SYSTEMS; (3) THE FORMATION OF
COORDINATED PROGRAMMES AND AIMS FOR SUCH GEOGRAPHICALLY-BASED SYSTEMS; (4) THE
NEED FOR LEVELLING-UP STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE WITHIN THE DIFFERENT
REGIONS; (5) THE NEED TO INCREASE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY GENERALLY.
CONSIDERATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT.
