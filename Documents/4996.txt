FRIEDRICH ALTHOFF'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRUSSIAN-GERMAN
LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
FRIEDRICH ALTHOFF LIVED FROM 1839-1908. HE WAS THE OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ADVISER
IN THE PRUSSIAN MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND THE MINISTRY'S DIRECTOR OF
UNIVERSITY AND FURTHER EDUCATION FROM 1897-1907. HE WAS CONVINCED THAT
LIBRARIES WERE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY AS A BASIS FOR ACADEMIC PROGRESS BUT ALSO IN
THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE AND NATIONAL AWARENESS. ALTHOFF WORKED IN CLOSE
COOPERATION WITH LIBRARY DIRECTORS, OTTO HARTWIG, KARL DZIATZKO AND AUGUST
WILMANNS. TOGETHER THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT INNOVATIONS IN
LIBRARY WORK WHICH WERE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE AND DEVELOPED THE PRUSSIAN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SYSTEM. AMONG THESE DEVELOPMENTS WERE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
PRUSSIAN LIBRARY COMPLETE CATALOGUE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF INTER-LENDING SYSTEMS
BETWEEN LIBRARIES, THE FOUNDING OF AN INFORMATION OFFICE OF GERMAN LIBRARIES
IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY IN BERLIN (1905) AND THE OPENING OF THE KAISER-WILHELM
LIBRARY  IN POSEN IN 1902.
