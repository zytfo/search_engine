INTEGRATION OF THESAURI IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONTA CONFERENCE, BIELEFELD, 24-27 MAY 81. DISCUSSES
THE OBJECTIVES AND COMPILATION OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED THESAURUS OF THE
SOCIAL SCIENCES, WHICH IS INTENDED TO ACT AS A MASTER REFERENCE TOOL, AS AN
AID IN SEARCHING ACROSS DATA BASES, OR A SWITCHING MECHANISM. THE 1ST STEP IN
COMPILATION SHOULD BE THE MERGING OF TERMS TO FORM A DESCRIPTOR BANK. TO
COMPARE THE MERGED TERMS AT THE CONCEPT LEVEL, ANALYSIS IN SUB-FIELDS IS
PROPOSED WITHIN A CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK, PREFERABLY 1 WITH A FACETED
STRUCTURE, SUCH AS THE 2ND EDITION OF THE 2BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
1THE CLASSIFICATION WOULD SERVE AS THE MASTER AGAINST WHICH THE TERMS FROM THE
MERGED INFORMATION LANGUAGES, ARRANGED IN A COMPATIBILITY MATRIX, WOULD BE
COMPARED. THE MASTER CLASSIFICATION WOULD BE MODIFIED DURING INTERACTION WITH
THE MATRIX TERMS, AND EMERGE AS THE INTEGRATED THESAURUS IN A FORMAT SIMILAR
TO THAT OF THE BSI ROOT THESAURUS, HAVING A D ETAILED CLASSIFIED DISPLAY AND
FULL ALPHABETICAL SECTION. PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE WORKED OUT IN THE SUB-FIELD OF
UNEMPLOYMENT USING TERMS FROM 5 THESAURI AND THE UDC. ALSO CONSIDERS
MULTILINGUAL IMPLICATIONS, TESTING AND UPDATING.
