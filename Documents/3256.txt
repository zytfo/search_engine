TECHNICAL-COMMUNICATION FUNDAMENTALS IN AN ERA OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
     
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS THAT EMPLOY COMPUTERS, CATHODE-RAY

INCREASING EXTENT. HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF THEIR MESSAGES AND THE CASE WITH
WHICH THESE CAN BE READ WILL BE CONSIDERABLY LESSENED UNLESS SYSTEM DESIGNERS
APPLY OR ADAPT MORE OF WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT TEXTUAL PRESENTATIONS AND
UNLESS WE OURSELVES PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO HOW WE WRITE.
