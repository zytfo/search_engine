INFOLOGICAL MODELS AND INFORMATION USER VIEWS.
     
THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRES INFORMATION CONTENT TO BE DEFINED
INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE HANDLING OF INFORMATION. THE INFOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
STRESSES THIS AND IS BASED ON A SEMANTICAL MODEL RATHER THAN A REAL-WORLD
MODEL. SOME OF THE BASIC INFOLOGICAL CONCEPTS DISCUSSED ARE THE INFORMATIONAL
REPRESENTATION OF DATA ITEMS, ELEMENTARY MESSAGES AND THEIR STRUCTURE, AND
E-SENTENCES. A LARGE NUMBER OF CONCEPTS AND TERMS IS REQUIRED WITH A
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION DATA DICTIONARY CONSISTENT WITH THE
RELEVANT USER VIEW. THE CHARACTERISTICS AND FORMATION OF CONCEPT DATA OBJECTS
AND PROPERTY REFERENCES ARE DESCRIBED, CREATING A HIERARCHIC CONCEPT
STRUCTURE. THE HERMENEUTICAL CIRCLE (INFOLOGICAL MEANING IN HERMENEUTICAL
TEXTS) IS DEMONSTRATED, AND THE INFOLOGICAL AND DATALOGICAL USER VIEWS ARE
DESCRIBED AND COMPARED.
