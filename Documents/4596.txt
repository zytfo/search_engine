THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TOWARDS THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING
OF STUDENTS.
     
THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED OF A PILOT SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT THE HUMBOLDT
UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN. THE 60 STUDENTS INTERVIEWED STRESSED THAT PERSONAL
CONTACT BETWEEN LECTURER AND STUDENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT AID TO EDUCATION,
WHEN ADVICE ON READING AND WORK METHODS COULD BE GIVEN; THEY ALSO VALUED
READING SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHER STUDENTS. AT LEAST 1/2 THE STUDENTS INTERVIEWED
FOUND THE LIBRARY STAFF HELPFUL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON LITERATURE STUDY. THE
LIBRARY WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR WORKING, ALTHOUGH DELAYS IN OBTAINING BOOKS
SOMETIMES HELD UP THE STUDY PROGRAMME. SOME STUDENTS FELT THAT CONCENTRATION
ON EXAMINATIONS IMPEDED THE GROWTH OF CREATIVE ABILITY. CLOSE CONTACT BETWEEN
LECTURERS AND LIBRARIANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS AND STUDY
METHODS.
