INTERFERING QUEUEING PROCESSES IN PACKET-SWITCHED BROADCAST COMMUNICATION.
     
CONSIDERS PACKET-QUEUEING PROCESSES IN 2 INTERFERING BUFFERED PACKET RADIO
UNITS THAT SHARE A SLOTTED ALOHA BROADCAST CHANNEL. SHOWS THAT CLASSICAL
APPROXIMATION SCHEMES FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PREDICTIONS CONCERNING
INTERFERING QUEUEING AND INTRODUCES A NEW SCHEME, TOPOLOGICAL APPROXIMATION,
WHICH PROVIDES AN EXACT SOLUTION OF AN APPROXIMATE MODEL, OBTAINED BY
PERTURBING THE TOPOLOGY OF INTERFERENCE. ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INTERFERENCE MAY
BE CURED BY INCREASING THE INTERFERENCE AND THAT 'MAXIMUM INTERFERENCE'
PROVIDES A SUPERB FLOW-REGULATING MECHANISM AND THE BEST POSSIBLE
DELAY-THROUGHOUT PERFORMANCE.
