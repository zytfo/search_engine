THE NEED FOR IMPROVED WORLDWIDE PROVISION OF PUBLICATIONS.

NATIONAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONAL
AVAILABILITY. THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE NEED FOR BETTER INTERNATIONAL
PROVISION IS SUPPLIED BY DATA ON INTERNATIONAL LENDING. THE VOLUME OF
INTERNATIONAL LENDING AND PHOTOCOPYING IS ABOUT 1 MILLION ITEMS A YEAR AND IS
GROWING RAPIDLY. SATISFACTION RATES AND SUPPLY TIMES BOTH NEED IMPROVEMENT.
ABOUT 2/3 OF DEMAND IS FOR JOURNALS, AND IS CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF
CENTRES, WHICH GIVE A MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE SERVICE. SPEED OF SUPPLY
APPEARS TO BE UNRELATED TO DISTANCE. POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF PROVISION FOR THE
FUTURE INCLUDE ACCESS TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL IMPRINTS, REGIONAL
SYSTEMS, AND LARGE NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES IN COUNTRIES WITH HEAVY
INTERLENDING DEMAND.
