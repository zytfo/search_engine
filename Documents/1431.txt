PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES
AND THE FORMAT OF THE NEW PATENT INDEX, DERIVED FROM THE INPADOC DATA AND
INTRODUCED IN JAN 81.
