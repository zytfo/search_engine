CIRCULATION VERSUS PHOTOCOPY: QUID PRO QUO?.

INFORMATION THOUGHT NECESSARY FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A LIMITED
JOURNAL CIRCULATION POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO,
INCLUDED THE EFFECTS ON SEATING, ON IN-HOUSE PHOTOCOPYING, AND ON CIRCULATION.
AN INITIAL ONE-WEEK SURVEY SHOWED JOURNAL CIRCULATION TO BE 7% OF THE TOTAL,
WITH JOURNALS ISSUED DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS COMPRISING 45% OF THE TOTAL. A
SURVEY OF USER PHOTOCOPYING PRACTICE SUGGESTED THAT CIRCULATION LIMITED TO
JOURNALS OVER 5 YEARS OLD MIGHT RESULT IN A 90% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING, AND
CIRCULATION SURVEY WERE USED TO PREDICT A 45% DECREASE IN CIRCULATION. RESULTS
OF IMPLEMENTING A LIMITED CIRCULATION POLICY WERE A 41% CIRCULATION DECREASE
AND A 136% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTION AND
RESULTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EFFECT OF DUPLICATE COPY SUBSCRIPTIONS AND
BY PROVISION OF CONVENIENT PHOTOCOPY FACILITIES.
