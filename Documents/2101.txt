READING AND LIBRARIES IN THE SOCIO-CULTURAL LIFE OF AN URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY.
     
TO OBTAIN A BROAD SOCIO-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE ROLE OF READING AND PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE IN AN URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE READING, PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE AND COMMUNICATIONS HABITS OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 406 HOUSEHOLDS AND
OF 123 ADULT LIBRARY MEMBERS (ALL IN PRETORIA) WERE STUDIED. THE FINDINGS
INDICATE THAT THE LIFESTYLE OF THE LIBRARY USERS AS A GROUP IS SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL BLACK POPULATION AND THAT LIBRARY USERS
COMMUNICATE MORE BROADLY (THROUGH TALKING WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE
FAMILY, PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES, AND USING A VARIETY OF MEDIA).
