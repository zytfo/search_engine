THE LIBRARY BILL AND THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
     
THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ON THE MINISTRY OF
CULTURE'S LIBRARY BILL OF 24 SEPT 81. THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL,
BUT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS. THUS IT SUPPORTS THE INCLUSION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN ONE ACT, BUT OPPOSES THE DECISION TO REMOVE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. IT SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE
AND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIBRARY
COUNCIL, ALBEIT WITH A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION. IT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ART
COLLECTIONS PUT ON A PAR WITH MUSIC COLLECTIONS, AND LIBRARY PROVISION FOR
INTERMEDIATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES MADE OBLIGATORY. THE LIBRARY
CENTRE, OF WHOSE BOARD THE ASSOCIATION HAS A MAJORITY MEMBERSHIP, IS WILLING
TO COOPERATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY
AND URGES THAT ITS FINANCING BE CLARIFIED SOON. THE ASSOCIATION REGARDS THE
AMOUNT SET ASIDE FOR TRANSITION OF P ART-TIME LIBRARIES TO FULL-TIME STATUS
TOO LOW. IT SUPPORTS THE CHANGE TO BLOCK GRANT FINANCING.
