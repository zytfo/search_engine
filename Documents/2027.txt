LIBRARY RESEARCH SHOULD BE DEFINED AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE.
     
COMMENTS ON A REPORT ON LIBRARY RESEARCH BY A COMMITTEE OF THE LIBRARIANS'
UNION. IT WRONGLY CONTRASTS LIBRARIANS AND ACADEMICS AS MOST LIBRARIANS HAVE
AN ACADEMIC TRAINING, BUT IT STRESSES THE NEED FOR A RESEARCH COUNCIL
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING LIBRARY RESEARCH IN ITS SPHERE. URGES THAT LIBRARY
RESEARCH SHOULD BE DEFINEED AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE, AND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE AN
AIM WIDER THAN THAT OF INCREASING EFFICIENCY. EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS SHOULD NOT
BE PART OF A LIBRARY RESEARCH COUNCIL, AS SUGGESTED IN THE REPORT. THE REPORT
RIGHTLY STRESSES THE NEED FOR FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IS WRONGLY
AGAINST GIVING FORMAL CREDIT TO SUCH TRAINING IN THE FORM OF A DEGREE, FEARING
UNNECESSARILY THE CREATION OF ELITE LIBRARIANS.
