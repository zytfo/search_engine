THIRD TIME LUCKY IN PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST?.

THE (UK) NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IS TO BE REORGANISED IN 1982 FOR THE THIRD
TIME SINCE THE WAR. THE 1974 CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT AS A HEALTH
CARE COMMUNITY IS TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF THE NEXT REORGANISATION AND MANY
MULTI-DISTRICT AREAS ARE TO BE SPLIT, AMALGAMATED OR REGROUPED. LIBRARIANS
HAVE DEVELOPED LIBRARY SERVICES OF THE NHS AS AN INFORMATION NETWORK, AND MUCH
OF THE COUNTRY IS NOW COVERED BY REGIONAL NETWORKS INCORPORATING NHS AND
MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THE NEW DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES MAY DISRUPT OR
CUT SERVICES ALTOGETHER, NHS FAILS FREQUENTLY TO RECOGNISE THE DIRECT
CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND SOME LIBRARIES
COULD COME UNDER THE ADMINISTRATORS OF INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS, ALTHOUGH BOTH THE
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND NHS REGIONAL LIBRARIANS GROUP ADVOCATE ORGANISATION ON
A DISTRICT RATHER THAN AN INSTITUTIONAL BASIS. LIBRARIANS MUST BE SEEN TO BE
CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE AND ACTIVELY CAMPAIGN FOR RECOGNITION WITHIN THE
NHS.
