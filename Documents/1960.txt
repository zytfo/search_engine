ELECTRONIC MAIL AND ITS IMPACT ON EUROPE.
     
TELETEX AND TELEMAIL ARE DISCUSSED AS POSSIBLE MEANS OF DEVELOPING AN
ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEMS WILL GROW
RAPIDLY. TELETEX WILL REMAIN IN THE CONTROL OF THE PTIS, HOWEVER THE PRICE OF
A TERMINAL IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT. A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM FROM
FRANCE IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. TELEMAIL IN THE UK IS CONTROLLED BY BRITISH
TELECOM AND AT PRESENT OFFERS A SIMILAR SERVICE TO THE TELEX SYSTEM.
