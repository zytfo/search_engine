MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE SERVICE' REFERENCE STATISTICS 1978/79' UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.

THE TYPES OF STATISTICS NEEDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A REFERENCE PROGRAMME
IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY WERE INVESTIGATED BY COLLECTING DATA ON VARIABLES SUCH
AS PEAK TIMES OF HEAVIST REFERENCE USE, TYPE OF REFERENCE QUESTIONS, TIME
SPENT IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, TYPE OF EMPLOYEE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, ADEQUACY
OF RESPONSES, REASONS FOR INADEQUATE ANSWERS, AND WHETHER PROFESSIONAL STAFF
WERE ANSWERING THE MORE SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA
INDICATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF AN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICE AND THAT A STANDARDISED DATA FORM COULD BE
USED FOR BOTH GENERAL REFERENCE SERVICE AND REFERENCE SERVICE IN A SPECIALISED
SUBJECT AREA.
