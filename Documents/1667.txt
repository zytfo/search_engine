PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY AUTOMATION,
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, 14-19 FEB 81. POINTS OUT THAT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN
LIBRARY AUTOMATION HAS EMPHASISED COOPERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS

OF SUCH PROJECTS. DESCRIBES THE AREAS IN WHICH STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED
OR ARE BEING DEVELOPED.
