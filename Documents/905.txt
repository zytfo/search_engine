ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW
SERVICE WITHOUT DUPLICATING EXISTING INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES.
