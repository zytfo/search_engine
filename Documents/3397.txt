PROBLEMS IN THE SIMULATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
PRESENTS A FORMAL PROBABILISTIC LOGICAL MODEL OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THE COMPUTER SIMULATION OF INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL FROM A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. DESCRIBES A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE MODEL AND ASSESS HOW WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS ABLE TO SIMULATE THE
CRANFIELD II AND MEDLARS RETRIEVAL TEST COLLECTIONS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY'S
