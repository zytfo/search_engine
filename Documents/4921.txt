THE NON-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT WITH A DEPARTMENT COMMON TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN THE
NEW LIBRARY IN EMMABODA, OPENED IN AUTUMN 80. THE SHAPE OF THE NEW LIBRARY
MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DIVIDE IT INTO DEPARTMENTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVINGS
IN ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN, OR FOR YOUNG
PEOPLE ON THE BORDERLINE OF ADULTHOOD PERSUADED THE LIBRARY TO TRY TO
INTEGRATE THE MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY IS DIVIDED INTO FICTION AND NON-FICTION,
WITH NON-FICTION BOOKS FOR CHILDREN PLACED AFTER THOSE FOR ADULTS ON THE SAME
SHELF; ADULT FICTION AND CHILDREN'S FICTION HAVE THEIR OWN SHELVES, BUT IN THE
SAME PLACE IN THE HALL. AN AREA IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUE DESK CONTAINS
PERIODICALS AND PICTURE BOOKS WITH SEATING FOR ALL AGES, INCLUDING HEADPHONES
FOR CHILDREN. AFTER A YEAR THE EXPERIENCE HAS PROVED ENTIRELY POSITIVE.
