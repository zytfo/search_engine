ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
IN THE 1980S, BULGARIAN LIBRARIES MUST MEET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REQUIREMENTS
TO BECOME IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO THE POPULATION'S AESTHETIC EDUCATION. TO BECOME EQUAL
PARTNERS IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES HAVE TO
REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR, AND THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND COORDINATION IN RESPECT OF BUILDING UP THEIR BOOK COLLECTIONS. ACQUISITION
OF PUBLICATIONS AND PERIODICALS FROM THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES MUST, IN
PARTICULAR, BE PLANNED VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIBRARIES MUST CONSIDER AS THE 1ST AND FOREMOST
DUTY THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE USSR
AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FROM WHICH PUBLICATIONS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING MUST BE BACKED UP AND EXPEDITED BY EFFICIENT TELEX AND
PHOTOCOPYING SERVICES. WELL-KEPT B IBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES NOT ONLY HAVE
INFORMATION VALUE BUT THEY ALSO HELP IN ATTRACTING NEW READERS.
