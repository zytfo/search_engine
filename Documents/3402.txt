USE OF A MAXIMAL COMMON SUBGRAPH ALGORITHM IN THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF
THE OSTENSIBLE BOND CHANGES OCCURRING IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS.
     
A FAST PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE LARGEST SUBSTRUCTURE
COMMON TO THE REACTANT AND PRODUCT MOLECULES IN A CHEMICAL REACTION. ONCE THIS
SUBSTRUCTURE HAS BEEN FOUND, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY AUTOMATICALLY THOSE
BONDS IN THE REACTING MOLECULES WHICH HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN BROKEN OR FORMED IN
THE COURSE OF THE REACTION; THESE BOND CHANGES COULD BE USED AS INDEXING TERMS
FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF CHEMICAL REACTION INFORMATION.
