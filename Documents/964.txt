RICHARD MINSKEY'S BRAINCHILD' THE CENTER FOR BOOK ARTS.

THE CENTER FOR BOOK ARTS, MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, EXISTS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC

SUCH WORKS. THE CENTER WAS CREATED IN 1974 BY RICHARD MINSKY TO COMBINE HIS 2

BOOK ARTS, INCLUDING HAND BOOKBINDING, RESTORATION, WOOD ENGRAVING AND
LETTERPRESS PRINTING. QUALIFIED ARTISTS AND CRAFTMAKERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE THE
FACILITIES FOR A MODEST RENTAL FEE. THE CENTER HAS BECOME AN INFORMATION

ATTENTION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BOOKS IN HISTORY AND PRESENT LIFE.
