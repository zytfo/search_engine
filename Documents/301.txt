DEVSIS: A PHILOSOPHY OF DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION.

IN THE ABSENCE OF THE INTERESTS WHICH LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMS SUCH
AS MEDLARS OR INIS, IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO COORDINATE THEIR
DOCUMENTARY RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR LEAST FAVOURED PEOPLE.
AFRICAN DEVSIS WILL FORM PART OF INTERNATIONAL DEVIS. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT THE
COORDINATING CENTRE WILL HAVE A SMALL, HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF AND EMPHASIS
WILL BE PLACED ON PROMOTING NATIONAL CENTRES. THE PAPER IS FOLLOWED BY A
DISCUSSION BY JOHN WOOLSTON OUTLINING THE GENESIS OF DEVSIS AND VARIOUS
EXPERIMENTS AND GRASS-ROOTS INITIATIVES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE ALONG DEVSIS
LINES. THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UN HAS YET TO DISCUSS GENERAL ADOPTION OF
THE PROGRAMME.
