A GLANCE ACROSS THE RHINE' THE FRENCH CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES.
     
THE 76 FRENCH CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES, COMPARABLE WITH THE GERMAN STATE
LIBRARY CENTRES, ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATION. EACH LIBRARY CONTAINS A GARAGE FOR THE MOBILE LIBRARIES, BOOK
STORES, OFFICES AND MULTI-PURPOSE ROOMS FOR COMMITTEE MEETINGS, CONFERENCES
AND STAFF TRAINING SESSIONS. LARGE BOOK STOCKS AVERAGING 300,000 VOLUMES LEAD
TO SPACE SHORTAGES. STAFF INCLUDE BOTH STATE EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS. HELP
FOR CULTURALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED AREAS IS PROVIDED BY' DIRECT LOAN TO THE PUBLIC
FROM MOBILE LIBRARIES; DEPOSIT LOAN IN FACTORIES, SCHOOLS, YOUTH CLUBS,
HOLIDAY RESORTS AND OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES; ORGANISATION OF BOOK-ORIENTED
ACTIVITIES. THE CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES' WORK REFLECTS THE CURRENT TENDENCY
TOWARD DECENTRALISATION.
