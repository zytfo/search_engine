A DECLINING READERSHIP CAUSED THE LIBRARY AT BAD NEUENAHR-AHRWEILER TO CLOSE
IN 1970. IN 1975 IT WAS REOPENED IN THE TOWN HALL AND PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION
HAS NOW BEEN FOUND IN A RESTORED BUILDING OF GREAT HISTORIC INTEREST TO THE
TOWN. READERSHIP HAS EXPANDED FROM 837 IN 1975 TO 4,400 IN 1981 (POPULATION
28,000). THE BOOKSTOCK OF ONLY 4,000 IN 1975 HAD RISEN TO OVER 15,000 BY 1979
AND FURTHER EXPANSION IS NOW PLANNED.
