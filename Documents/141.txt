CITATION AND CO-CITATION INDICATORS OF A PHASED IMPACT OF THE BCS THEORY IN
THE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY.

AN INTELLECTUAL ACCOUNT OF THE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY WAS COMPARED WITH
CITATION AND COCITATION DATA DURING 2 HISTORICAL PERIODS THAT COINCIDED WITH
THE INTRODUCTION OF ITS CENTRAL EXPLANATORY THEORY (BCS). INVESTIGATES THE
COCITATION DATA THROUGH FACTOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS GIVE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT TO A
HYPOTHESIS THAT DISTINGUISHES IMPACT PHRASES IN THE EFFECT OF THE THEORY ON
THE COGNITIVE ORGANISATION OF THE SPECIALITY. IT IS ALSO OBSERVED THAT
CITATION AND COCITATION DATA ARE SEPARATE TYPES OF INFORMATION WHICH, UNDER
SOME HISTORICAL CONDITIONS, GIVE DIFFERING RESULTS.
