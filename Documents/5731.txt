A NEW CONCEPT OF FURTHER TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE SCHEME, WHOSE TEXT IS INCLUDED, WAS DEVISED BY DAS ZENTRALINSTITUT FUR
BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IN 1981. GENERAL
TRAINING ON CULTURAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS IS PROVIDED TOGETHER WITH VARIOUS
TYPES OF SPECIALIST MATERIAL AND INFORMATION FOR MANAGEMENT. THE COURSE
INCLUDES LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND VISITS TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT LIBRARIES; USE
IS MADE OF FACILITIES IN LARGE CENTRAL ORGANISATIONS AND IN SMALL BRANCH
LIBRARIES. THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM TRAINING COURSES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN
POTSDAM AND ERFURT HAS PROVED VALUABLE. ALL PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN MUNICIPAL
AND RURAL LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY WILL HAVE A REGULAR TRAINING PROGRAMME; IN
SOME AREAS A TRAINING CENTRE HAS BEEN CREATED TO SERVE SEVERAL LIBRARIES.
