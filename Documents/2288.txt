A PROPOSED NEW OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM.
     
A PROPOSED OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH
THE CURRENT SYSTEM. 4 MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED.
1ST, THE NEW OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD SIMPLIFY AND REDUCE
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. 2ND, THE NEW DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD PROVIDE A
TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE CURRENT STATE OF READINESS OF OPERATIONAL UNITS
THROUGHOUT THE NAVY. 3RD, THIS SYSTEM COULD BE USED AS A BASIS FOR MAKING
PREDICTIONS CONCERNING STAFFING AND MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ANY MEDICAL
FACILITY UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED OUTPATIENT
SYSTEM COULD BE TIED TO THE CURRENT INPATIENT SYSTEM TO DERIVE COMPLETE
MEDICAL HISTORIES FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. BY MERGING THE 2 DATA SYSTEMS A
RESEARCH TOOL WOULD BE CREATED THAT COULD PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH AN
UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT, DISTRIBUTION, CAUSES,
AND PREVENTION OF DISEASE.
