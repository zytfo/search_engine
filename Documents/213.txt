RESEARCH STUDY ACCOMMODATION FROM THE USER'S POINT OF VIEW.

THE IDEAL RESEARCH STUDY IS SITUATED CLOSE TO THE REFERENCE FACILITIES, BUT
WITH A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FROM A CORRIDOR. IT SHOULD HAVE A WINDOW, A LARGE
DESK, A SEPARATE DESK FOR TYPING, PLENTY OF SHELVES AND DRAWERS, AND IT SHOULD
BE AVAILABLE FOR USE FROM 8 AM TO 8 PM. BOTH PUBLIC AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE RESEARCH STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR USE IN FINLAND. THEY CAN BE BOOKED FROM 2
WEEKS TO 1/2 A YEAR DEPENDING ON THE LIBRARY AND THE TYPE OF STUDY UNDERTAKEN
BY THE USER.
