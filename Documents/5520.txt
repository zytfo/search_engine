THE ALA/ACRL RELATIONSHIP.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. DISCUSSES THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND REFERENCE LIBRARIES (LATER, ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH
LIBRARIES). ACRL CAME INTO EXISTENCE AS A RESPONSE TO THE SEPARATE NEEDS OF
ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. THE ALA/ACRL RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN ROCKY OVER THE
YEARS-SOME SEE IT AS AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP, OTHERS AS A PARENT/ADOLESCENT CHILD
RELATIONSHIP. A 1981 SUMMIT MEETING IN CHICAGO SUGGESTED SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGES IN THE ALA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THESE SUGGESTIONS ARE INVESTIGATED IN
SOME DETAIL.
