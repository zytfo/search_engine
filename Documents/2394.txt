NOTATION FOR INDEXING LANGUAGES AND CLASSIFICATIONS (IN GERMAN).
     
AN OVERVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE BASIC TYPES OF NOTATION THAT CAN BE DESIGNED.
INCLUDED ARE THE SEQUENTIAL (OR PURELY ORDINAL) NOTATIONS WITH HIERARCHICAL
LEVEL INDICATOR. IT IS SHOWN THAT LEFT ALIGNED SEQUENTIAL NOTATIONS ARE VERY
FLEXIBLE. THE EVALUATION OF NOTATIONS, CARRIED OUT WITH AN EXAMPLE, IS DONE
WITH A QUITE COMPREHENSIVE CATALOGUE OF DESIDERATA. FOR DESIGN DECISIONS, THE
METHODS OF WORTH ANALYSIS ARE RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER
OR NOT TO EMPLOY NOTATION AT ALL. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO USE NOTATIONAL
SYMBOLS ONLY FOR CERTAIN HIERARCHICAL LEVELS.
