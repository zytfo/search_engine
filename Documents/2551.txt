LIBRARY PROVISION OF MUSIC-A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE TEACHING OF MUSIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL.
MENTIONS A SWEDISH PROTEST LETTER AGAINST THE PROPOSED ABOLITION OF SUCH
TEACHING. ALTHOUGH ABOLITION IS NOT SUGGESTED IN DENMARK, MUCH IN THE LETTER
IS APPLICABLE TO DANISH CONDITIONS. IT THUS POINTS OUT THAT LIBRARIES WITH
THEIR NON-COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVES CAN COUNTERACT THE PREDOMINANCE OF LARGE
FOREIGN RECORD COMPANIES. IT ARGUES THAT NOW THAT MUSIC DEPARTMENTS IN
LIBRARIES ARE BEING REDUCED, LIBRARIANS SHOULD RECEIVE MORE INSTRUCTION IN
MUSIC LIBRARIANSHIP SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES.
NOW WHEN THE TRAINING IS TO BE REVISED, THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE GRASPED TO
GIVE MUSIC A HIGHER PRIORITY IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL.
