THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WALTER HOFMANN AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN TOWARDS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF USER RESEARCH METHODS, PART I.
     
HOFMANN AND ANGERMANN CARRIED OUT THEIR RESEARCH AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
CENTURY, DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR POPULAR EDUCATION. THEY FELT
THAT LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EACH READER'S REQUIREMENTS FROM AND
MOTIVATION TOWARDS READING SO THAT THE LIBRARY COULD PERFORM EFFECTIVELY ITS
EDUCATIVE FUNCTION. HOFMANN ADVOCATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACT
BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS AND OF TYPOLOGICAL GROUPING OF READERS WITH THE AID
OF LOAN FREQUENCY STATISTICS. HIS NEW CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR SUBJECT
INDEXES WAS USED IN COMPILING CATALOGUES OF THE LEIPZIG BUCHERHALLE. HOFMANN
ALSO FAVOURED THE USE OF SELECTIVE INDEXES AIMED AT TARGET GROUPS IN ADDITION
TO THAT OF GENERAL CATALOGUES.
