THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PUBLIC LIBRARIES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO HANDICAPPED
PEOPLE IN THE USA. CHANGES IN THE LAWS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE MAKING OF ALL
PUBLIC BUILDINGS ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THIS HAS LED TO NEW STANDARDS
FOR BUILDING AND THE RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS SOME OF WHICH HAVE REQUIRED
CONSIDERABLE WORK. THE NEW LAWS HAVE CAUSED CONTROVERSY IN SMALL TOWNS WITH
FEW, IF ANY, HANDICAPPED PEOPLE OVER WHO SHOULD PAY FOR RENOVATION WORK.
CONCLUDES THAT CLEARER GUIDELINES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO MAKE THE LAW MORE
FLEXIBLE AND TO GUARANTEE THAT SMALL TOWN BUILDINGS SUCH AS LIBRARIES ARE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD
ALSO CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING FOR ACCESSIBILITY RENOVATIONS.
