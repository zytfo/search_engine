DISSEMINATION OF THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL TRIAL' AN
ANALYSIS OF THE CITING LITERATURE.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CITATION ANALYSIS STUDY OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL
TRIAL WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A TECHNIQUE FOR TREATING
DIABETICS. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHY THIS TECHNIQUE WAS STILL
NOT WELL KNOWN 18 MONTHS AFTER ITS PUBLICATION. CONCLUDES THAT A LARGE NUMBER
OF CITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE TO A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PAPER DO NOT OF
ITSELF ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED WILL READILY REACH THE APPROPRIATE
PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. STRESSES THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THE
RAPID DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT NEW FINDINGS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
