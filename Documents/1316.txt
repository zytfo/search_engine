REFERENCE UPDATE. HOW OLD IS IT AND HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?.

IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE USA HAS 22 MILLION 'COLLECTORS OF ONE KIND OR
ANOTHER, MOSTLY ANOTHER'. ALL WANT TO FIND A FORTUNE IN THEIR ATTIC AND,

TREASURE. SUGGESTS SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES WHICH THE LIBRARIAN CAN
CONSULT TO DISCOVER THE AGE AND VALUE OF THE COLLECTIONS.
