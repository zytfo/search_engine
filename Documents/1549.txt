INTERVIEW WITH N. MOORE, PROJECT OFFICER IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH
AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY. DEFINES RESEARCH AS THEORETICAL RESEARCH, WHICH
PROVIDES GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR USERS, AND
RESEARCH WHICH SEEKS TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND HELP LIBRARIANS PROVIDE
BETTER SERVICES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE LATTER. RECENT
RESEARCH HAS BEGUN TO LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE RESULTS
ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE SERVICES. THE BRITISH LIBRARY SUPPORTS RESEARCH
INVESTIGATING RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, COOPERATION AND STAFF ORGANISATION IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO
FURTHER EDUCATION. THIS RESEARCH IS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CARRIED OUT BY
PRACTISING LIBRARIANS, OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE
BRITISH LIBRARY ALSO FINANCES RESEARCH CENTRES, WHICH INITIATE RESEARCH, BUILD
UP COLLECTIONS OF RESOURCE MATERIAL AND ADVISE RESEARCHERS. AN ADVISORY COMM
ITTEE ON PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH HELPS THE BRITISH LIBRARY COORDINATE RESEARCH.
