CURRENT PROBLEMS IN WORK WITH RARE EDITIONS.
     
THE PROBLEMS OF ACQUIRING AND RECORDING RARE EDITIONS, LEAVING ASIDE
PRESERVATION AND READER SERVICES, ARE MULTITUDINOUS. THERE IS NO ACCEPTED
DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A RARE BOOK' ITS AGE CAN BE EASILY DEFINED, BUT
NOT SO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS CONTENT OR PUBLICATION. CENTRAL AND REGIONAL
LIBRARIES APPLY DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND METHODS OF COLLECTION ARE HAPHAZARD.
FOLLOWING A RECENT STATEMENT BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ON PRESERVING
CULTURAL TREASURES, LIBRARIES SHOULD REGISTER LOCAL PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OF
RARE BOOKS AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT THEM BEING DISSIPATED, CREATE UNION
CATALOGUES OF THEIR HOLDINGS, AND A LIST OF THE NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT
COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE COMPILED AND PUBLISHED.
