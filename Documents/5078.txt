SPECIAL COLLECTIONS IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

THE SPECIAL COLLECTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS GUIDE COMPRISE THEMATICALLY RELATED
GROUPS OF MATERIAL MAINTAINED AS SEPARATE UNITS WITH THE GENERAL HOLDINGS OF
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. THEY WERE EITHER ACQUIRED AS A UNIT OR SPECIFICALLY
ASSEMBLED BY THE LIBRARY. ALTHOUGH VALUABLE RESOURCES, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE
OFTEN CHALLENGING TO USE AS THEY ARE NOT RECORDED IN A SINGLE CARD CATALOGUE
OR MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASE BUT RATHER IN A VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC GUIDES.
FURTHERMORE, SOME SPECIAL COLLECTIONS ARE SO VAST THAT IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO
PROVIDE AN ITEM-BY-ITEM LISTING. SEEKS TO GUIDE THE RESEARCHER TO RESOURCES
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OVERLOOKED AND DESCRIBES SPECIAL COLLECTIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN SINGLED OUT BY THE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE STAFF FOR THEIR RARITY OR
POTENTIAL INTEREST TO SCHOLARS AND SUMMARISES THE HISTORY, CONTENT, SCOPE,
SUBJECT STRENGTHS AND ORGANISATION OF THESE GROUPS OF MATERIALS. THOUGH
LIMITED TO 269 OF THE MANY SPECIAL COLLECTI ONS, IT ILLUSTRATES AN APPROACH
THAT CAN BE APPLIED FOR THE EFFECTIVE USE OF SIMILAR RESOURCES.
