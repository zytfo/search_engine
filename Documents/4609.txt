REFERENCE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
CONSIDERS THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE BLOEMFONTEIN PUBLIC LIBRARY SOUTH
AFRICA. THE REASONS WHY PUPILS IN THE 11-16 YEARS AGE GROUP USED THE LIBRARY
AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ARE GIVEN AS DETERMINED THROUGH A SURVEY. STUDENTS
WERE NOT SIMILARLY SURVEYED BUT IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR LIBRARY USE ARE GIVEN.
ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS SERVING THESE 2
GROUPS, AND TO METHODS OF DEVELOPING THESE CAPABILITIES. SOURCES OF
INFORMATION MUST PROVIDE MANY LEVELS OF ENTRY TO INFORMATION TO CATER FOR
CHILDREN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF SWIFT ADVANCEMENTS IN
THE EDUCATION OF BLACK CHILDREN, SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN EXPECT
GREAT STRAINS IN THE 1980S IN PROVIDING THE REQUIRED REFERENCE SERVICES.
