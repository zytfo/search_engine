INCREASING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION.
     
ISOLATES 6 PAIRS OF INTER-RELATED FACTORS (INFORMATION AND USER, DOCUMENT AND
SEARCH DESCRIPTIONS, DESCRIPTOR AND SUBJECT WORD, OBJECT AND PROCESS, HIGHER-
AND LOWER-RANK CONCEPTS, AND SELECTION AND REDUCTION), SOME OF WHICH MAY
INTERFERE WITH SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION
(ESPECIALLY IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS). TO ELIMINATE SUCH INTERFERENCE, PROPOSES
THAT' A FORMULA SPECIFYING INFORMATION NEED MORE PRECISELY SHOULD BE
INTRODUCED; WHILE INDEXING, SUBJECT (RATHER THAN DOCUMENT) CONTENT SHOULD BE
DESCRIBED; CONCEPT CHARACTERISTICS, RATHER THAN UNIFIED KEY WORDS, SHOULD BE
USED; PROCESS-ORIENTED WORDS SHOULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE CHANGES IN TIME;
HIGHER-RANK CONCEPTS SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF THEY ADEQUATELY COVER ALL
SUBORDINATED CONCEPTS; AND ELEMENTS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SHOULD NOT BE
MIXED WITH THOSE AIMED AT CONTENT DESCRIPTION.
