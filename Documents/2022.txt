LIBRARY SCIENCE CONGRESSES' EVALUATION AND PERSPECTIVES.
     
REPORT ON THE AIMS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE 10TH BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCIENCE AND
DOCUMENTATION CONGRESS, COMPARING THE CAREFUL STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED HERE WITH
THE HAPHAZARD NATURE OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS. THE ACCOUNT ANALYSES THE PROBLEMS
PREVIOUSLY ENCOUNTERED IN CONFERENCE ORGANISATION, RESULTING IN LOSS OF
PRINCIPLE FOCUS AND DISSIPATION OF INTEREST. IN CONTRAST THIS CONGRESS WAS
BASED ON A DOMINANT CENTRAL THEME, SUB-THEMES WERE KEPT STRICTLY RELEVANT, AND
BOTH OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL PAPERS CAREFULLY MONITORED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA FOR SELECTING TOPICS AND PAPERS. THE SESSIONS,
DISCUSSION GROUPS AND WORKSHOPS WERE SIMILARLY CONTROLLED, TO ACHIEVE A
SESSION IN WHICH INTEREST AND PURPOSE WERE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT. SUGGESTS
FURTHER WAYS OF DEVELOPING THIS KIND OF CONGRESS ORGANISATION AND EMPHASISES
ITS BENEFITS TO THE PROFESSION AS A WHOLE AND INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS.
