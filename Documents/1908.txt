ANSWERING THE CHALLENGE OF TELETEXT, VIEWDATA SYSTEMS AND OTHER FAST GROWING
COMMUNICATIONS, SUCH AS HOME COMPUTERS.
     
NEWSPAPERS ARE FACING CHALLENGES FROM THE NEW MEDIA OF TELETEXT, VIEWDATA
SYSTEMS, AND HOME COMPUTERS. TELETEXT PROVIDES NEWS IMMEDIATELY, SIMPLY,
CONVENIENTLY, AND INEXPENSIVELY. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BROWSE AND
SCAN OPTIONS OF NEWSPAPERS. OF GREATER POTENTIAL IMPACT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
VIEWDATA SYSTEMS WHICH USE THE TELEVISION, TELEPHONE, AND COMPUTER SO THAT
ON-LINE SEARCHING CAN BE DONE FROM THE HOME. THE SYSTEM CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED
TO USE A HOME COMPUTER RATHER THAN A TELEVISION SCREEN. CHANGES IN HOW PEOPLE
SPEND THEIR LEISURE TIME AND THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME, COMBINED WITH THE
STAGNATION OF NEWSPAPER READERSHIP AND THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE OF
INFORMATION IN SOCIETY, SUGGEST THAT NEWSPAPERS SHOULD LOOK INTO NEW OPTIONS.
