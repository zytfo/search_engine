BATH UNIVERSITY LIBRARY/BURROUGHS MACHINES LTD. AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL
SYSTEM' ITS DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION.
     
(FLA THESIS.) A STUDY OF THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT
BATH UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (UK) WITH BURROUGHS MACHINES LTD. TRACES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT FROM THE INITIAL PLANS, THROUGH DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION TO OPERATION, AND GIVES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
SYSTEM-EQUIPMENT, PROGRAMS, INPUT, OUTPUT AND BACKUP. EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED DURING THE USE OF THE SYSTEM AND ACTION TAKEN TO REMEDY SOME OF
THESE, WITH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER PROBLEMS. THESE PROBLEMS LED TO
SUSPENSION OF THE SYSTEM IN 1978 AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY THE SWALCAP SYSTEM
(SOUTH WEST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES COOPERATIVE AUTOMATION PROJECT), WHICH HAS
PROVED RELIABLE AND SATISFACTORY.
