PUTTING IT ON FILM.

COMPUTER OUTPUT TO MICROFILM (COM) HAS NOT BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL COMPUTING
TECHNIQUE, DUE PARTLY TO A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNOLOGY. RECENT COM
IMPROVEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE GREATER COMPETITION WITH
ALTERNATIVE METHODS. WITH MICROFILM, GOOD READABILITY AND HIGH QUALITY
TYPOGRAPHICAL LAYOUT CAN BE ACHIEVED AND NOW FEATURES, SUCH AS GRAPHICS, ARE
AVAILABLE.
