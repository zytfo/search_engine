THE USE OF SUBJECT SPECIALISTS IN SUHL DISTRICT PUBLIC RESEARCH LIBRARY.

THE DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY IS NEW TO EAST GERMANY. THE LARGE, HIGH-QUALITY
STOCK IS HELPFUL FOR THE REGIONAL STOCK-BUILDING PROGRAMME; MOST DOMESTIC
PUBLICATIONS ARE ACQUIRED TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN WORKS NEEDED FOR RESEARCH.
EACH DEPARTMENT IS CONTROLLED BY A SUBJECT SPECIALIST RESPONSIBLE FOR STOCKS,
CATALOGUING, ADVISORY AND INFORMATION WORK, ORGANISATION, STAFF TRAINING AND
COORDINATION WITH INDUSTRY AND OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. IN SUHL THERE ARE
SUBJECT SPECIALISTS FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SOCIAL SCIENCE, CHILDREN'S
BOOKS, EARTH SCIENCES AND MUSIC. SUCH DEMANDING POSTS REQUIRE UNIVERSITY
GRADUATES WITH DETAILED BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE AND AN ADDITIONAL
QUALIFICATION IN LIBRARIANSHIP. IT MIGHT ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBJECT
SPECIALISTS FROM THE RANKS OF GRADUATE TEACHERS.
