THE POLICIES AND STRATEGIES OF QUEBEC PUBLISHERS.

BASED ON A THESIS FOR THE MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY. THE MARKETING AND
PUBLISHING STRATEGIES OF QUEBEC FRENCH LANGUAGE PUBLISHERS IN 1960-77 ARE
ANALYSED, USING THE RESULTS OF A 1978 SURVEY, IN TERMS OF PUBLISHING POLICIES.
RESULTS SHOW A SHIFT FROM RELIGIOUS TO IDEOLOGICAL PUBLISHING; A CONTINUING
DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'CULTURAL' AND 'PRACTICAL' BOOKS: AND A LARGELY
UNSTRUCTURED INDUSTRY.
