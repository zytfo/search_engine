THE ENFORCED RE-ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES.
     
(FLA THESIS). CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AS PART OF A PROFIT-MOTIVATED
ORGANISATION, PROVIDING A LITERATURE AND INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE BENEFIT
OF ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE SERVICE PROVIDED MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THE
MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY. AS PART OF THE ORGANISATION
THE LIBRARY IS SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT CONTROL IN THE SAME WAY AS ANY OTHER PART
OF THE ORGANISATION. MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MADE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THAN THE
LIBRARY, AFFECT THE LIBRARY'S OPERATION AND ITS FUNCTIONS AND STAFF. THE
EFFECT OF THESE DECISIONS ON THE LIBRARY ARE EXAMINED IN A NUMBER OF CASES
WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE POLICY DECISIONS TAKEN BY FERRANTI LTD IN
1975, AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE COMPANY LIBRARIES.
