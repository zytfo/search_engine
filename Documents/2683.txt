TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL APPROACH TO LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE PROVISION OF
REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES IS NOW BECOMING APPARENT. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW
THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES WILL
NECESSITATE THE CREATION OF A NETWORK OF WELL-STOCKED LIBRARIES IN EACH
REGION. IN ORDER TO FINANCE SUCH A POLICY WHILST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE
SUFFERING SEVERE ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT LESS
ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE RECREATIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN
ADDITION, RESEARCH BY THE BIBLIOTHEEKRAAD (LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL) INTO
INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
COOPERATION ON ACQUISITION POLICIES AMONGST THE LIBRARIES OF EACH REGION. IN
ORDER TO BRING LIBRARIES TOGETHER IN CLOSER COOPERATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY
TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS AND TO CHANGE THE PRESENT
LAW RELATING TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
