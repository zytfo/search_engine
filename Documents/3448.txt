A PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM FOR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR SEARCHING.
     
A DETERMINISTIC NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SEARCH ALGORITHM IS MODIFIED SO THAT THE
USER CAN SPECIFY A MAXIMUM TOLERABLE LEVEL OF ERROR. THIS TOLERANCE ALLOWS
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ALGORITHM TO BE HANDLED PROBABILISTICALLY AND THIS, IN
TURN, ALLOWS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SEARCH SPEED DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF
ERROR PERMITTED. THUS, SEARCH TIME CAN BE TRADED OFF AGAINST SEARCH
EFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM IS SUBSTANTIALLY
FASTER THAN THE DETERMINISTIC, WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL LOSS IN RETRIEVAL
QUALITY.
