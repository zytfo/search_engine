THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO CCNY GRANTS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND LIBRARIANSHIP HAD MUCH IN COMMON IN THE 1930S,
STEMMING FROM A COMMON UK TRADITION, YET EACH COUNTRY MADE QUITE A DIFFERENT
RESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATE
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE WAS MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND MANY
DEVELOPMENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE 1930S-40S; IN AUSTRALIA, SOME EQUIVALENT
DEVELOPMENTS WERE NOT ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE 1960S. EXAMINES THE REASONS FOR
THIS.
