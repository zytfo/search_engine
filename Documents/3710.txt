EQUIVALENCE OF LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONS' PROBLEMS.
     
HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEMS OF LACK OF EQUIVALENCE OF QUALIFICATIONS OBTAINED FROM
LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THE BARRIERS TO
THE FREE FLOW OF LIBRARIANS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. PRESENTS FINDINGS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S (COMLA) WORKING PARTY ON RECIPROCITY OF
QUALIFICATIONS PRESENTED IN 1975 AND CRITICISMS OF ITS REPORT AT A COMLA
SEMINAR. DISCUSSES STANDARDISATION OF COURSES INTERNATIONALLY AND SUGGESTS
THAT COMLA SHOULD RESEARCH STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL AND SUB-PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING, AS WELL AS SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND SHOULD PRODUCE AN UPDATED LIST OF
SCHOOLS REACHING THE REQUIRED STANDARDS. ALSO SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUAL
COUNTRIES COULD SET UP COMMITTEES TO ADVISE EMPLOYERS ON FOREIGN
QUALIFICATIONS.
