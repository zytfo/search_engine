KBF HAS GOT 10,000 (KRONER) TOWARDS A PILOT PROJECT ON WORK ENVIRONMENT AND
AUTOMATION.
     
IN JUNE 80 THE NORWEGIAN MINISTRY OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND EMPLOYMENT GRANTED
THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS (KBF) FUNDS FOR A PILOT PROJECT
TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE GROUNDS FOR MORE EXTENDED RESEARCH ON WORK
ENVIRONMENT, AUTOMATION AND THE LIBRARY. THE ASSOCIATION HAS POINTED OUT THAT
PREVIOUS REPORTS ON COMPUTERISATION IN LIBRARIES IGNORED PROBLEMS OF WORKING
CONDITIONS AND EMPLOYMENT, AND THAT THE EMPLOYEES' ORGANISATIONS SHOULD TAKE
THE INITIATIVE IN INVESTIGATING THEM. THEY AIM TO CHART PROBLEMS ARISING FROM
THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN (1) WORKING CONDITIONS-PHYSICAL, JOB
STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT, STAFF/READER RELATIONS; (2) POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF
EMPLOYEES ON PLANNING AND INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS; (3) EMPLOYMENT AND
FINANCE' WILL AUTOMATION FREE STAFF FOR OTHER WORK OR LEAD TO DISMISSALS? AND
WILL THE EXPENSE OF COMPUTERISATION MEAN CUTS IN OTHER ASPECTS OF LIBRAR Y
SERVICE?.
