THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SWISS SOCIAL SCIENCE ARCHIVE.

THE SWISS SOCIAL SCIENCE ARCHIVE COLLECTS ALL SWISS MATERIAL AND MUCH FROM
ABROAD ON SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. STOCKS INCLUDE 80,000 BOOKS,
600,000 NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS AND A PAMPHLET COLLECTION OF 500,000 ITEMS. THE
ARCHIVE HAS A KEYWORD INDEX OF 350 TERMS; UDC WAS USED UNTIL 1959, WHEN THE
ARCHIVE INVENTED ITS OWN DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIALISED
COVERAGE. IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY NON-COMMERCIAL MATERIAL
BUT THE ARCHIVE RECEIVES MANY GIFTS OF PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. THE ARCHIVE HAS 12
STAFF AND AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 900,000 FR, INCLUDING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE
TOWN AND CANTON OF ZURICH AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SWISS SOCIAL
SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION HAS AN IMPORTANT CENTRE HERE AND IS BEING IMPROVED
THROUGH THE ARCHIVE'S WORK WITH OTHER DOCUMENTATION CENTRES.
