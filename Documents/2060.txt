A COMMISSION WITH POSSIBILITIES-IN SPITE OF ALL.
     
DISCUSSES THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION
(FOLKBIBLIOTEKSUTREDNINGEN) IN SWEDEN AFTER 1 YEAR'S WORK. SUGGESTS THAT THE
COMMISSION SHOULD FORMULATE NOT ONLY CULTURAL, BUT ALSO SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL
GOALS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT SHOULD INDICATE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES IN
COOPERATION WITH SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION ORGANISATIONS CAN SAVE THE BOOK
AT A TIME WHEN AURAL AND VISUAL MEDIA THREATEN TO TAKE OVER. TO THIS END THE
COMMISSION HAS BEGUN TO COOPERATE WITH THE CULTURAL COUNCIL'S PLANNED
LITERATURE CAMPAIGN IN THE KOPPARBERG REGION. THE COMMISSION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
THE EQUALISATION OF SERVICES BY PLACING MORE EMPHASIS ON THE REGIONAL
LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THIS RESPECT. ANY EXTRA MONEY SHOULD BE CHANNELLED THROUGH
THE REGIONAL LIBRARY.
