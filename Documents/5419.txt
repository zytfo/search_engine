PROPOSAL FOR LEGAL AMENDMENT TO THE BELGIAN LAW OF 22 MARCH 1886 WITH
REFERENCE TO REPROGRAPHY.

2 SEPARATE PROPOSALS LAID BEFORE (1) THE BELGIAN SENATE IN MAR 81, AND (2) THE
BELGIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES IN OCT 80 RESPECTIVELY. EACH BEGINS WITH A
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION SHOWING HOW TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE RENDERED
MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL LAW NECESSARY, INVOKING THE BERNE CONVENTION AS A
GUIDING PRINCIPLE. THE PROPOSALS THEN SET OUT IN DETAIL LARGELY SIMILAR
SUGGESTIONS FOR INSERTION OF AMENDMENTS, WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMMENT ON AND
JUSTIFICATION OF THE POINTS COVERED, WHICH INCLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR AUTHORS'
PERMISSION, LIMIT ON MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES, OBLIGATIONS OF OWNERS OF
REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT, AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.
