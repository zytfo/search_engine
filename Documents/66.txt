MEASURING LIBRARY SERVICES-TO CUT COSTS?.

DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF MEASURING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES,
PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO INTRODUCE A
PROCESS WHEREBY LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS COSTS AND
PERFORMANCE TO THE PUBLIC, WITH THE RESULT THAT EXPENDITURE BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES IS REDUCED TO THE LOWEST SPENDING AUTHORITY'S LEVEL, AND NOT TO
THE LEVEL OF THE AUTHORITY PROVIDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY SERVICES. MEASURES
SHOULD REFLECT THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF THE SERVICES OFFERED, AND LIBRARIAN'S
ATTEMPTS TO AUDIT THEIR WORK WILL IMPROVE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO DO FOR SOCIETY.
