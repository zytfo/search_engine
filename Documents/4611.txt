GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO AUTHOR'S OWN WORK CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION WITH THE
PSYCHIATRIC DEPARTMENT OF THE DISTRICT MEDICAL CENTRE. PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS
ARE GIVEN 1 HOUR PER WEEK OF GROUP READING, DISCUSSIONS, AND WRITING SHORT
ESSAYS ON SELECTED LITERATURE IN THE PRESENCE OF A LIBRARIAN, A PSYCHOLOGIST
AND A PSYCHIATRIST. BIBLIOTHERAPY AIMS AT BREAKING THE SILENCE BARRIER AND

BIBLIOTHERAPY FROM CLINICS INTO LIBRARIES FOR PATIENTS RELEASED FROM
INSTITUTIONAL CARE. SCHOOLS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST, AS
SPECIALISED LIBRARIANS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS WORK.
