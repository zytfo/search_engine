A VIEW FROM BARBADOS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. INTERLENDING IN BARBADOS IS ASSISTED BY THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF THE MAJOR LIBRARIES, WHICH HAVE GOOD TELEPHONE LINKS.
INTERNATIONAL REQUESTS ARE ROUTED VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST INDIES LIBRARY TO
THE BLLD FOR JOURNALS, BUT TO A WIDER SELECTION OF LIBRARIES FOR MONOGRAPHS.
THE CHOICE IS DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR MONOGRAPH REQUESTS, AND
AUTOMATED UNION CATALOGUES PRODUCED IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD HELP IN THIS
RESPECT. SMALL COLLECTIONS OF PERIODICALS SATISFY A HIGH PROPORTION OF DEMAND,
BUT ACTUAL TITLES REMAIN TO BE IDENTIFIED.
