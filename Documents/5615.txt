THE LIBRARIES GO TO SEA.

THE CONCEPT OF THE 'WORKPLACE' LIBRARY-A SWEDISH ADVANCE-HAS ATTRACTED MUCH
ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. RESULTS, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN OF VARIABLE EQUALITY
AND ONLY IN A FEW LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAS IT BEEN POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE A
FIRMLY ESTABLISHED OPERATION STRONGLY ANCHORED IN THE WORKPLACES. ONE SECTOR
OF THE SWEDISH LABOUR MARKET, HOWEVER, HAS FOR MANY YEARS ENJOYED A SMOOTHLY
FUNCTIONING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. THE SWEDISH SEAMEN'S LIBRARY SERVES THE
PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SWEDISH MERCHANT FLEET. BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY ARE TO BE
FOUND ON ALMOST ALL SWEDEN'S MERCHANT SHIPS, ABOVE ALL THOSE ON THE OCEAN
ROUTES.
