CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ACTIVITIES (IN ARABIC).

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ENLIVEN LIBRARY USE. READINGS AND
TALKS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE, AND OTHER
ACTIVITIES INCLUDE STORY HOURS, DRAMA, QUIZZES, COMPETITIONS AND READING
PROGRAMMES. THESE MOTIVATE READING AND ORIENTATE CHILDREN WITHIN THE LIBRARY.
NON-BOOK MATERIALS CAN ALSO BE A MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARY
ACTIVITIES.
