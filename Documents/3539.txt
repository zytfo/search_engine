THE NEED FOR LIBRARIES.
     
THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS AS WELL AS THE COMPUTERISATION OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY THE STAFF OF A SPECIAL
DEPARTMENT AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA. NOW, THE TIME
HAS COME TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES, SIMILAR
TO THE ONE IN PRAGUE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA. AMONG THE CENTRE'S 1ST AND FOREMOST
COMMITMENTS SHOULD BE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE CONTEMPORARY
WORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THEIR UP-TO-DATE
EQUIPMENT. THIS BROAD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE POOLED FOR THE NEW,
SPECIFIED LIBRARY BUILDINGS, AND ALSO FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION AND
MODERNISATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES. SUCH ACTIVITIES SHOULD LEAD TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF ARCHIVES OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION AND INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS, LIBRARIANS AND OTHERS. OTHER
LONG-TERM TARGETS INCLUDE THE DESIGN OF A NEW, PROGRESSIVE METHOD OF SERVICE
TO  READERS AND INFORMATION USERS AND TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF BOTH WORK AND
PRIVATE LIVES.
