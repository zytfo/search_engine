USE OR VALUE OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES STATEMENTS.
     
MAN ABSTRACTS EXPERIENCE INTO SYMBOLS AND USES THEM TO REDIRECT HIS ENERGIES
IN MANIPULATING THE REAL WORLD. THE ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THUS
ABSTRACTED CHANGE SO RAPIDLY THAT MAN HAS DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING THEM.
ABSTRACTIONS OF ORGANISATIONS (SUCH AS LIBRARIES) SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS
HAVING A REALITY. STATEMENTS MADE ON THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF ORGANISATIONS
ARE AT BEST LIKE HYPOTHESES WHICH ARE TEMPORARY DESCRIPTIONS OF AN ENVIRONMENT
THAT MUST BE TESTABLE TO BE OF VALUE. THE MARK OF A HEALTHY ORGANISATION RESTS
ON THE FERVOUR WITH WHICH IT TESTS GOALS.
