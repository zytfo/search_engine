THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT.
     
ANALYSES THE DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
OF SERIALS DEPARTMENTS, LOOKING IN PARTICULAR AT THE CURRENT PRACTICES IN
AUSTRALIAN TERTIARY LIBRARIES. IN MOST LIBRARIES, THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
APPEARS TO BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS HISTORICAL ACCIDENTS, SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES, PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENTS, OR ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS, AND NOT
ON ANY ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
SPECIAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN SERIALS WORK. WITH SHRINKING BUDGETS REINFORCING
THE TREND TOWARDS LIBRARY COOPERATION AND AUTOMATION, LIBRARIES WILL NEED TO
REVIEW THEIR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES TO SUIT FUTURE TECHNOLOGY.
