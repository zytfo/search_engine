A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN EAST
AFRICA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY SYSTEM
FAVOURED BY THE WEST IS APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO
STUDY THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR AREA, ITS
CURRENT STATUS, AND ITS PLANNED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
(KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANZANIA) WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY AS ITS LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ENABLE A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ANALYSIS.
IN FUTURE, THERE MUST BE A BALANCE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF APPOSITE WESTERN
IDEAS AND REJECTION OF THOSE IDEAS HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY. FINANCIAL SUPPORT
IS BECOMING MORE ASSURED; THE RECOGNITION OF LOCAL REQUIREMENTS MUST FOLLOW.
