LEGAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). MOST PLR
PROPONENTS CONTENT THAT PLR LEGISLATION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW,
BUT IN ONLY 1 OF THE 10 COUNTRIES TO ENACT PLR LEGISLATION HAS THE STATUTE
BEEN MADE A PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW. THE PLR CONCEPT DOES NOT FIT NEATLY INTO
THE PRINCIPLES OF US COPYRIGHT LAW, BUT THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF 2DROIT
DE SUITE1 LEGISLATION (REQUIRING PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES TO ARTISTS FOR RESALE OF
THEIR WORKS) IN CALIFORNIA IS AN INDICATION THAT PLR IS A WORKABLE CONCEPT IN
THE US LEGAL STRUCTURE.
