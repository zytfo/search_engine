COMMUNITY INFORMATION: THE LIBRARY'S ROLE.
     
(CONTRIBUTION TO A DEBATE ON LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION.) LIBRARIANS
MAKE THE MISTAKE OF SEEING COMMUNITY INFORMATION AS BEING JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF
INFORMATION, AND THEY FALL FOR SOME VERY BASIC FALLACIES: (1) THE ASSUMPTION
THAT OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS THE ONLY VALUABLE INFORMATION; (2) THAT IF A
LITTLE INFORMATION IS GOOD THEN A LOT MUST BE BETTER; (3) THAT OBJECTIVE
INFORMATION CAN BE TRANSMITTED OUT OF CONTEXT; (4) THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY
ACQUIRED THROUGH FORMAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS; (5) THAT INFORMATION IS RELEVANT
TO ALL EVERYDAY NEEDS, WITH AN INFORMATION SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS; (6) THAT
INFORMATION NOT NOW AVAILABLE CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE; AND (7) THAT FUNCTIONAL
UNITS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS CORRESPOND TO THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS OF THE USER.
