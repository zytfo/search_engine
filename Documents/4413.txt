AN ALTERNATIVE ISBN CHECKING ALGORITHM.
     
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBER IS WELL KNOWN AS A TITLE IDENTIFIER IN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, AS A CONTROL NUMBER FOR ISBN ASSIGNED
MONOGRAPHS APPEARING ON THE UK MARC RECORD, AND AS A STOCK-ITEM IDENTIFIER IN
THE BOOK TRADE. EQUALLY WELL-KNOWN IS THE HELPFUL CHARACTERISTIC THAT ISBNS
EXHIBIT WHEREBY THEIR 10TH AND FINAL CHARACTER SERVES AS A CHECK-DIGIT,
MINIMISING DATA ENTRY ERRORS. OTHER WELL-KNOWN IDENTIFIERS, SUCH AS THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NUMBER AND THE BRITISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY NUMBER WHICH
SERVE RESPECTIVELY AS CONTROL NUMBERS ON THE LC MARC RECORD AND ON THE UK MARC
RECORD FOR NON-ISBN ASSIGNED MONOGRAPHS, DO NOT EXHIBIT COMPARABLE
SELF-VALIDATING CHARACTERISTICS.
