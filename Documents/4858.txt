A GUIDE TO REFERENCE TOOLS FOR CATALOGING AFRICANA.
     
AFRICANA MATERIALS ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO CATALOGUE. THE NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS ABOUT AND FROM AFRICA HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LAST 2
DECADES, PROPORTIONATELY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PROBLEM BOOKS. ALTHOUGH MUCH
HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AFRICANA, VERY LITTLE
ACTUALLY AIDS THE CATALOGUER IN FINDING ANSWERS TO THE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS
RAISED BY THESE MATERIALS. ANSWERS ARE FOUND IN SCATTERED AND SOMETIMES
OBSCURE PUBLICATIONS. THERE HAS LONG BEEN A NEED FOR A GUIDE TO THESE SOURCES
OF INFORMATION. HERE IS SUCH A GUIDE, COMPILED WITH THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE
GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST CATALOGUER IN MIND.
