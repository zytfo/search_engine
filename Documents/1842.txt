THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL
CONDITIONS' THE PROBLEMS OF THE INCREASED DANGERS OF DAMAGE AND DECAY IN AREAS
OF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.
     
THE GENERAL POINT IS STRESSED THAT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND
SUB-TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DANGERS AS THOSE IN MODERATE
CLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,
SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL
CLIMATES THERE IS THE THREAT OF DAMAGE BY INSECTS OF A NATURE AND TO AN EXTENT
THAT IS UNKNOWN IN MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO
CHANGE THIS SITUATION FUNDAMENTALLY BY ANY CONSERVATION OR RESTORATION
MEASURES, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC IN
PRESENT TERMS OF MANPOWER AND ENERGY.
