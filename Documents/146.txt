PUBLIC LIBRARY BOARDS: AN EXPLORATION OF THEIR VIABILITY IN LIBRARY GOVERNANCE.

WHILST LIBRARY BOARDS HAVE FOR A LONG TIME GOVERNED US PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THEY
ARE RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS, BUT FEW LIBRARIANS ARE WILLING TO PUBLICISE THEIR
DISSATISFACTION WITH PRESENT BOARD-LIBRARIAN RELATIONSHIPS. BRIEFLY SURVEYS
THE HISTORY OF LIBRARY BOARDS AND THEIR PRESENT MODUS OPERANDI. SUMMARISES
RESEARCH FINDINGS ON LIBRARY BOARDS. MAIN FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A
SERIOUS LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND TRUSTEE; BOARDS TEND TO BE
ADVISORY ONLY; AND THERE IS A TREND TOWARDS MAINTENANCE OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY
BOARDS-BUT BOARDS MUST BE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF COMMUNITIES, A MOVE THAT
WOULD BROADEN THEIR POLITICAL BASE AND HELP IN SECURING SUPPORT.
