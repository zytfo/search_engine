BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY: BALANCING THE BOOKS.

OUTLINES THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY AND ITS RICH
COLLECTIONS; DESCRIBES THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES NOW ACTING ON IT (THE BUDGET
SUBMITTED IN SPRING 80 WAS CUT FROM $11.3 MILLION TO $9.3 MILLION AND A
FURTHER CUT OF 35% IS RUMOURED); OUTLINES THE RESULTANT DAMAGE TO SERVICES
(BOOKMOBILE SERVICE, MULTILINGUAL LIBRARY, AND HOSPITAL LIBRARY SERVICE UNITS
ALL CLOSED; OPENING HOURS EVERYWHERE SEVERELY CURTAILED); AND DISCUSSES THE
ACTIONS OF THE DIRECTOR AND THE MAYOR OF BOSTON (WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
MAKING LIBRARY TRUSTEE APPOINTMENTS ON POLITICAL GROUNDS RATHER THAN BY
MERIT).
