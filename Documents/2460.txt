FUTURE POSSIBILITIES FOR PRODUCTIVE READING.
     
3 SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPEED OF READING AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS READ.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT SPEED AND UNDERSTANDING DO NOT CHANGE IN PARALLEL. UP TO A
CRITICAL POINT THEY FOLLOW EACH OTHER; THEREAFTER FURTHER INCREASES IN SPEED
ARE ACCOMPANIED BY DECREASES IN UNDERSTANDING. THIS CRITICAL POINT CAN BE USED
AS AN INDEX OF READING ABILITY FOR ANY GIVEN READER. LIBRARIES SHOULD PROMOTE
THE USE OF MORE PRODUCTIVE READING TO ENCOURAGE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THEIR
RESOURCES.
