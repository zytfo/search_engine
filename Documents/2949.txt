INDEXING EXHAUSTIVITY AND THE COMPUTATION OF SIMILARITY MATRICES.
     
SOME OF THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
DERIVE CLUSTERS OF DOCUMENTS FROM AN INTERMEDIATE SIMILARITY MATRIX, THE
COMPUTATION OF WHICH INVOLVES COMPARING EACH OF THE DOCUMENTS IN THE
COLLECTION WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED THAT MANY OF
THESE COMPARISONS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE BETWEEN DOCUMENTS HAVING NO TERMS IN
COMMON, MAY BE AVOIDED BY MEANS OF THE USE OF AN INVERTED FILE TO THE DOCUMENT
COLLECTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH WILL EFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER
OF INTERDOCUMENT COMPARISONS ONLY IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE EACH INDEXED BY A
LIMITED NUMBER OF INDEXING TERMS; IF EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS USED, MANY
DOCUMENT PAIRS WILL BE COMPARED SEVERAL TIMES OVER AND THE COMPUTATION WILL BE
GREATER THAN WHEN CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES ARE USED TO GENERATE THE SIMILARITY
MATRIX.
