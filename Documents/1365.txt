ORIEL COMPUTER SERVICES-CIRCULATION SYSTEM.

ORIEL'S APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A CIRCULATION SYSTEM MATCHES ITS APPROACH TO
ITS OTHER LIBRARY AUTOMATION SERVICES. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A MODULAR
FASHION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR LIBRARY. THE APPROACH IS TO DISCUSS
WITH STAFF THE LIBRARY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND FROM THESE TO DESIGN A
SYSTEM WHICH MEETS THOSE NEEDS AT MINIMUM COST. A CIRCULATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN
OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE
GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, SYSTEM ELEMENTS, NETWORK, HARDWARE, SYSTEM
FACILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
