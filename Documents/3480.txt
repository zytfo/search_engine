PALANTYPE MACHINE SHORTHAND IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SPEECH TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM
FOR THE DEAF. THE EQUIPMENT CONVERTS PALANTYPE MACHINE SHORTHAND INTO ENGLISH
SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND DISPLAYS THE TEXT ON A VISUAL DISPLAY FOR THE DEAF
PERSON(S) TO READ. EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM TRIALS WITH DEAF BUSINESS EXECUTIVES
AND AT MEETINGS ATTENDED BY THE DEAF INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM ALSO HAS
APPLICATIONS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE, AND IN VERBATIM REPORTING. THESE
SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL AND COMPARIONS ARE MADE WITH
CONVENTIONAL QWERTY KEYBOARD INPUT WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS, AND WITH
STENOGRAPH MACHINE SHORTHAND TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR VERBATIM
REPORTING IN THE USA.
