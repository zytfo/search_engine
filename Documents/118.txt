NEED FOR PRIMARY PERIODICALS AS DETERMINED BY SDI.

AN INVESTIGATION OF PRIMARY PERIODICALS THAT APPEARED IN REFERENCES SELECTED
FROM CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS CONDENSATES WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE OUTPUT FOR ABOUT
2,000 PROFILES. FREQUENCY LISTS, IN ALPHABETICAL AND RANK ORDER, WERE CREATED
FOR THE DATA OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF ROUTINE PROCESSING OF 2 VOLUMES: 86 AND
89. IN BOTH ISSUES, A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF JOURNALS, FOR EXAMPLE, 212
AND 220 OUT OF 6,209 AND 7,039 TITLES, RESPECTIVELY, SUPPLIED 50% OF THE
RELEVANT PAPERS FOR SDI USERS. THE METHOD IS DESCRIBED, AND THE RESULTS ARE
COMPARED WITH THE CASSI LIST OF JOURNALS MOST FREQUENTLY CITED IN CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS.
