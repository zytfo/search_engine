A NEW CONCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF A FLEXIBLE OFFICE SYSTEM.
     
PRESENTS OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS AS AN APPLICATION OF MICROPROCESSOR BASED
SYSTEMS. THE SMALL SIZE, LOW COST, AND REASONABLY HIGH POWER OF THESE SYSTEMS
ENABLED THEIR USE IN AUTOMATING SOME OFFICE TASKS. PRESENTS A GENERAL
DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM, THEN
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCH
SYSTEMS. PROPOSES A SCHEME FOR PARTITIONING AND MODULARISING THE HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE OF THE SYSTEM, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOLUTION OF SOME
PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY, PORTABILITY AND SYSTEM EXTENSIBILITY. THE PROPOSED
SYSTEM CAN BE USED AS A UNIVERSAL BASIC CORE ON WHICH ONE CAN EASILY BUILD
LARGER WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE USER CAN, BY HIMSELF, EXTEND HIS SYSTEM BY
USING THE SAME WORD PROCESSING LANGUAGE HE USES EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF ITS
SPECIAL PROPERTIES PRESENTED HERE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SIMPLY RECONFIGURABLE AT
THE WILL OF THE USER TO EXACTLY FI T HIS NEEDS AT ANY TIME.
