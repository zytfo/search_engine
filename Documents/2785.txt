TECHNICAL INFORMATION FLOWS THROUGH FORMAL AND INFORMAL CHANNELS AMONG
ENGINEERS IN A DESIGN COMPANY. ENGINEERS' INFORMATION NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED,
AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR WHILE SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION, OR WHILE OBTAINING IT BY
CHANCE, WAS ANALYSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INFORMATION CHANNELS, BOTH FORMAL
AND INFORMAL, INTERACT IN A COMPLEX WAY, ALTHOUGH FOLLOWING SPECIFIC PATTERNS,
AND THAT THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER DURING THE PROCESS OF INFORMATION
ACQUISITION.
