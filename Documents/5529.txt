LIBRARY EDUCATION IN CANADA.

OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA
FROM THE LATE 1920S. CANADA HAS TENDED TO FOLLOW THE US PATTERN AND ALL
CANADIAN LIBRARY SCHOOLS STILL SUBMIT THEIR PROGRAMMES TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION FOR ACCREDITATION. HOWEVER ANYONE CAN CALL HIMSELF A 'PROFESSIONAL
LIBRARIAN' AND LIBRARIES DO NOT HAVE TO HIRE GRADUATES FROM ACCREDITED
SCHOOLS. MOST PROGRAMMES RUN FOR 2 YEARS FOR A MASTER'S DEGREE, THE 1ST YEAR
FULL TIME AND THE 2ND PART TIME. SCHOOLS HAVE RECENTLY ORIENTED THEIR
PROGRAMMES AWAY FROM TRAINING IN ROUTINE TECHNIQUES AND TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR
PLANNING, ADMINISTRATION, THE SETTING OF STANDARDS, ORGANISING POLITICAL
ACTIVITY FOR LIBRARY SUPPORT, DEPLOYMENT OF HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES,
FUND-RAISING AND NEW METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND SUBJECT ANALYSIS.
