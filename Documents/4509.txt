THE JENA LITERARY MUSEUM 1816-1919.
     
THE MUSEUM WAS ADMINISTERED BY A GROUP OF MEMBERS WITH LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC
INTERESTS WHO WISHED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON POLITICAL AND TOPICAL MATTERS
OUTSIDE THEIR WORK. THE BUILDING UP OF A COMPREHENSIVE PERIODICAL COLLECTION
FORESHADOWED A MODERN TREND. STOCKS WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH COOPERATIVE
AGREEMENTS WITH' THE GRAND DUKE'S LIBRARY IN WEIMAR; JENA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY,
FOR WHICH THE MUSEUM BECAME A READING-ROOM UNTIL 1915; THE WEIMAR BOOK MUSEUM;
THE CARL ZEISS FOUNDATION. MANY PRIVATE MEMBERS ALSO DONATED THEIR JOURNALS TO
THE MUSEUM. WHEN THE PUBLIC READING ROOM OPENED IN JENA IN 1896, REFLECTING
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AND POLITICAL THOUGHT, IT FLOURISHED; THE MUSEUM,
IN CONTRAST, WISHED TO REMAIN THE PRESERVE OF A WELL-EDUCATED, FEE-PAYING
MINORITY AND THUS RESTRICTED ITS OWN DEVELOPMENT. ULTIMATELY THE MUSEUM BECAME
PART OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
