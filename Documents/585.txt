USER SATISFACTION IN THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY.

A USER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY TO DETERMINE
THE DEGREE OF USER SATISFACTION AND IDENTIFY LIMITING FACTORS. ANALYSIS OF
DATA FROM 203 DATA SHEETS COMPLETED BY PATRONS REQUESTING SPECIFIC TITLES
REVEALS THAT ACQUISITIONS BY THE LIBRARY AND USER ERROR ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT
LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS
POLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATE
LIBRARY SEARCHING TECHNIQUES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED
FOR POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES AND
SIGNS ALERTING THEM TO COMMONLY COMMITTED ERRORS OF THE LOCATION OF SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABL E FROM NTIS.
