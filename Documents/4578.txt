DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING 1981.
     
REPORT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE 1981 ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION BY LISE OSTERGAARD. THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE TRANSFER OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FROM
THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IS REVIEWED. IT IS THE TASK OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,
HOWEVER, TO ENSURE THE OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER IN PROMOTING CULTURAL, INFORMATIONAL AND
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE CHANGE IN THE LAW GOVERNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS A
STEP FORWARD, STRENGTHENING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARY
CONTROLLED BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. PRODUCTION OF BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT AND HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN
DENMARK OVER THE LAST 10-20 YEARS, LARGELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. 80% OF ALL DANISH CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE PURCHASED BY PUBLIC, SCHOOL
AND INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. THE FUT URE OF SUCH BOOKS DEPENDS ON THE
WILLINGNESS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IN SPITE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, TO PROVIDE
YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A BROAD RANGE OF LITERATURE.
