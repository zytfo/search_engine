THE CHANCES OF A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNICATION
SCIENCES FOR LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN BERLIN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO THE UNIVERSITY
AS PART OF THE COMMUNICATION SCIENCE FACULTY, THE 1ST TIME THAT THIS HAS
OCCURRED IN GERMANY. OBJECTIONS TO UNIVERSITY STATUS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES
WERE FORMERLY MADE ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES OCCUPY ONLY 6
SEMESTERS WHERE OTHER UNIVERSITY COURSES REQUIRE 8 OR 9 AND THAT A UNIVERSITY
COURSE WOULD PROVIDE INADEQUATE PRACTICAL TRAINING. IF LIBRARIANSHIP IS TO BE
REGARDED AS PART OF COMMUNICATION SCIENCE NEW THEORETIC FIELDS MUST BE
DEVELOPED WHICH WILL AFFECT LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING. LIBRARIANS MUST BE TRAINED
IN CRITICAL MEDIA SELECTION AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION; IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIANSHIP PERSONAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS MUST BE
IMPROVED TO COUNTERACT THE IMPERSONAL EFFECTS OF INCREASING CENTRALISATION.
LIBRARIANS NEED A BETTER GENERAL EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CONNECTED ACADEMIC
SUBJECTS LIKE SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY.
