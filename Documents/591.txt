WHAT MY PUPILS TAUGHT ME ABOUT CHILDREN'S BOOKS.

REPORT ON A STUDY BY A SUSSEX JUNIOR-SCHOOL LIBRARIAN OF THE LIBRARY'S POLICY
OF BOOK PROVISION. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PRESENTED TO 90 CHILDREN IN A LOCAL
MIDDLE SCHOOL ON THEIR READING INTERESTS. THIS PILOT STUDY ENABLED THE
LIBRARIAN TO ALTER THE RESEARCH DESIGN, NOTABLY BY PROMPTING INCREASED PUPIL
PARTICIPATION AND AN IMPROVED QUESTIONNAIRE. 258 CHILDREN IN THE AUTHOR'S OWN
SCHOOL TOOK A STANDARDISED COMPREHENSION TEST AND COMPLETED THE NEW
QUESTIONNAIRE. A PANEL OF CHILDREN CATALOGUED THE SCHOOL'S 4,793 BOOKS UNDER 2
MAIN CLASSIFICATIONS-FICTION AND INFORMATION, AND SORTED THEM INTO 50
CATEGORIES. DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS WERE TAPED. 1 IN 20 BOOKS WERE ASSESSED
FOR THEIR READABILITY LEVELS. A COMPARISON OF READING AGES AND READABILITY
LEVELS OF THE BOOKS SHOWED EXTENSIVE MISMATCHING OF LITERATURE TO PUPILS.
DETAILED RESULTS ARE PRESENTED AND ANALYSED.
