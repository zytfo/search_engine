THE LIBRARY OF THE LIEPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. STRUCTURE, DEVELOPMENT AND
PRESENT SITUATION.
     
THE LEIPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY WAS FOUNDED IN 1977-80. BEFORE THEN
SEVERAL SMALLER INSTITUTES AND COLLEGES OF ENGINEERING AND RELATED SUBJECTS
EXISTED, ALL WITH SOME KIND OF LIBRARY. THESE LIBRARIES WERE INTEGRATED TO
FORM THE NEW LEIPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTE HAS A
DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE AND THE LIBRARY WAS ORGANISED ON THE SAME LINES. THERE
IS A MAIN LIBRARY WITH 5 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES, CONCENTRATING PARTICULARLY ON
BUILDING COLLECTIONS FOR POLYGRAPHY AND CIVIL ENGINEERING, BESIDES BEING
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTIONS OF ALL THE RELATED SUBJECTS. THE LIBRARY PROVIDES
SUPPORT IN TRAINING AND RESEARCH FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF OF THE INSTITUTE AND A
RISE IN LIBRARY USERS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN
EXPANDED, ESPECIALLY WITH SIMILAR INSTITUTES IN THE USSR. AMONG THE PROJECTS
PLANNED FOR 1981 ARE THE FORMATION OF A SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR CIVIL
ENGINEERING AND COLLECTING AND CATALOGUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TRAVEL
AND CONFERENCE REPORTS.
