INFORMATION TRANSFER' A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, INFORMATION
SCIENCE AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY WORK. TRADITIONALLY, THERE ARE 5 BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH THE LIBRARY AND
LIBRARIANSHIP PERFORM FOR SOCIETY-ARCHIVAL, CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL,
RECREATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL. UNFORTUNATELY, LIBRARY EDUCATION, WHILE GIVING
LIP-SERVICE TO THE OTHER FUNCTIONS, HAS REMAINED PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ARCHIVAL
ACTIVITIES. PROPOSES A THEORETICAL MODEL OF INFORMATION TRANSFER. THE
RESPECTIVE ROLES OF LIBRARIANS, INFORMATION SCIENTISTS AND INFORMATION
MANAGERS ARE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THIS MODEL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 5 FUNCTIONS
DISCUSSED ABOVE. IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRICULUM DESIGN ARE DISCUSSED.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES OF STUDY BASED ON A COMMON CORE, BUT WITH
DISTINCT AREAS OF SPECIALISATION FOR STUDENTS TRAINING FOR THE 3 PROFESSIONAL
FIELDS, ARE PRESENTED.
