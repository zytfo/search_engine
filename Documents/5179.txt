LISTS OF NEW ACQUISITIONS' A CONTRIBUTION TO LIBRARY PUBLICITY.

IN JUNE 78 131 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY ISSUED LISTS OF NEW
ACQUISITIONS; THE 116 REPLIES RECEIVED SHOWED THAT 49 DID ISSUE SUCH LISTS AND
67 DID NOT. SUITABLE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO EACH GROUP; DETAILED ANALYSIS
IS GIVEN OF THEIR ANSWERS ON AIMS BEHIND LIST ISSUE, LIST STRUCTURE, TARGET
GROUPS, PRODUCTION FORMS, COSTS, ADVERTISING, POSSIBILITIES OF USE CONTROL,
ALTERATION PROCESSES, CRITICISM AGAINST LISTS AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO
THEM. PRODUCTION OF THESE LISTS IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING; EACH LIBRARY
MUST DECIDE FOR ITSELF WHETHER IT IS WORTH PRODUCING THEM. IF BETTER USE IS TO
BE MADE OF THE LISTS, MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE SELECTION OF MATERIAL
AND TARGET GROUPS. IN FUTURE, SPECIFIC SUBJECT LISTS INCLUDING NON-COMMERCIAL
WORKS WILL PREDOMINATE OVER LISTS OF GENERAL MATERIAL AND ELECTRONIC DATA
PROCESSING WILL BE USED INCREASINGLY IN THEIR PRODUCTION.
