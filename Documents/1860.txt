SOME QUESTIONS ON DEALING WITH SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.
     
THE CURRENT CZECHOSLOVAK STANDARD CSN 01 0195 (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND CATALOGUING
RECORD) DOES NOT CONTAIN AN EXHAUSTIVE DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS, BUT A
REWORKING OF THIS STANDARD IS PLANNED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THUS, A MORE
DETAILED GUIDANCE MUST BE SOUGHT IN VARIOUS CATALOGUING DIRECTIVES PUBLISHED
BETWEEN 1969 AND 71, WHICH GIVE A GOOD DESCRIPTION AND NUMEROUS PRACTICAL
EXAMPLES. SPECIAL MATERIALS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED ARE SHEET MUSIC AND RECORDS,
PATENTS AND STANDARDS, GRAPHICS AND AUDIOVISUALS, ARCHIVE MATERIAL AND
DOCUMENTS. RATIONAL APPROACH TO WORK WITH SPECIAL DOCUMENTS INCLUDES GROUP
CATALOGUING AND MACHINE PROCESSING, ESPECIALLY OF TECHNICAL MATERIAL.
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES SHOULD EXTABLISH WHICH MATERIALS CAUSE LIBRARIES THE
MOST PROBLEMS AND DEVISE WAYS OF SOLVING THEM.
