THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL MEETING OF EXPERTS FROM NATIONAL LIBRARIES OF SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES ON ACQUISITIONS AND INTERNATIONAL BOOK EXCHANGE (BUDAPEST, 2-6
OCTOBER 1979).
     
THE MAIN TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE 3RD MEETING WERE' THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
OF PUBLICATIONS AND THE DESIGN OF A MODEL OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW. ALTHOUGH A
SYSTEM OF DUPLICATES EXCHANGE HAS NOW BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE EXCHANGE OF
MICROFILMS HAS INCREASED, 1 AREA OF EXCHANGES NOT YET FUNCTIONING SMOOTHLY IS
OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. A MORE UNIFIED APPROACH WILL HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED
BEFORE THE SYSTEM CAN BECOME FULLY EFFECTIVE. THE WORKING GROUP SET UP TO
INVESTIGATE THE POSITION OF THE COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT PRESENTED THEIR
RECOMMENDATION TO PRODUCE A MODEL OF THE COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT LAW FOR SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES AS THE MODEL PRODUCED BY THE IFLA'S SECTION ON NATIONAL LIBRARIES
DOES NOT SUIT THE CONDITIONS OF MULTINATIONAL AND FEDERAL COUNTRIES AND
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN GENERAL.
