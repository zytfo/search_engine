WHAT AN IMMIGRANT NEEDS IN THE LIBRARY.
     
EXAMINES THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO DENMARK'S 100,000 IMMIGRANTS. THE 'QUEST
WORKER COLLECTION' IN GENTOFTE LIBRARY, SET UP IN 1970, HAS NOT YET SOLVED THE
PROBLEM OF SELECTION OR ACQUISITION OF SUITABLE MATERIAL. BEST RESULTS HAVE
BEEN ACHIEVED WITH ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN. MEETINGS BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND
IMMIGRANTS COULD IMPROVE SERVICES. INFORMATION TO THE DANES ABOUT IMMIGRANTS
IS VARIED AND SHOULD BE ACQUIRED BY LIBRARIES. BUT THERE IS A LACK OF MATERIAL
IN DANISH ON THE IMMIGRANTS' HOME BACKGROUND AND COOPERATION IS HAMPERED BY
LACK OF IMMIGRANT LEADERS. THE LIBRARY SCHOOL HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE SUBJECT
UP. 2 REPORTS FROM THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE (1973, 1980) COME UP WITH
PROPOSALS, AND AN ETHIOPIAN BORN LIBRARIAN, I. ABDULLAHI, IN HIS 'DESCRIPTION
OF IMMIGRANTS AND LIBRARIES IN DENMARK' (1981), CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE. HE
LISTS THE INFORMATION FROM LIBRARIES WHICH IMMIGRANTS NEED AND SUGGESTS WAYS
OF IMPROVING SERVICES, SOME OF WHICH NEED MO NEY, OTHERS ONLY IMPROVED
PERSONAL EFFORT AND REORGANISATION OF EXISTING WORK.
