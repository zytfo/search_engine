CHANGING PATTERNS OF INFORMATION USE IN PLANNING.
     
2 STUDIES CONDUCTED OVER A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS REVEALED A NUMBER OF
CONSISTENCIES IN THE USE OF INFORMATION IN PLANNING, BOTH AS FAR AS THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION IS CONCERNED AND THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN UTILISATION OF
EXISTING SOURCES ON THE SUPPLY SIDE. DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THAT
PERIOD REFLECT THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS OF BOTH ADVISORY AND
STATUTORY NATURE. THESE RESULT IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMS-WIDE APPROACH
AND AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF IMPROVED INFORMATION BASES. FURTHER
IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, NOTABLY IN THE FORM OF IMPROVED
LINKAGES AND CONTINUED DISSEMINATION OF EXPERIENCE WHETHER POSITIVE OR
NEGATIVE.
