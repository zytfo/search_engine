A DESIGN FOR COOPERATION AND NETWORKING AMONG ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF IRAN.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY.) THE STATUS AND ATTITUDES OF
IRANIAN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WAS INVESTIGATED, USING QUESTIONNAIRES AND
INTERVIEWS. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT THE COUNTRY'S ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WERE
NOT FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT BE AND THAT GRADUAL GENERAL CHANGES,
PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COOPERATION AND JOINT ACTION, WERE TAKING PLACE.
AN OVERALL PLAN WAS DEVISED WITH THE FOLLOWING FEATURES' COOPERATIVE
ACQUISITION, CENTRALISED AND COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING, EXPANSION OF LIBRARY
SERVICES, AND COOPERATIVE MANPOWER RESOURCES.
