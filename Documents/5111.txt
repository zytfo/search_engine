COINCIDENCE METHODS AND THE TWO-LEVEL CONCEPT.

COINCIDENCE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO RANK DISTRIBUTION IN
THE REPORT LITERATURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS)
AND A 2-LEVEL CONCEPT USED FOR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS IN THE PRESENT AND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION
LEVELS, WITH REFERENCE TO CONSTANT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, ARE COMPARED WITH
EACH OTHER AS WELL AS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AT
CONSTANT LEVELS. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 'INFORMATION AVALANCHE' FOR THE
HIGHLY SPECIALISED INFORMATION SCIENTIST, THE GREATER EFFECTIVITY OF REPORT
LITERATURE AS COMPARED WITH PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN THE FIELDS OF NUCLEAR
RESEARCH AND THE NONCOMPATIBILITY OF MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION LEVELS CAN BE
QUANTITATIVELY CONFIRMED. THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOW MICROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION
CAN BE CHANGED INTO MACROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION.
