CHINESE COLLECTIONS IN THE U.S.A.
     
A REPORT OF A STUDY TRIP IN 1979, SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION FOR
FRANCO-AMERICAN CULTURAL EXCHANGE TO INVESTIGATE CHINESE COLLECTIONS IN U.S.
LIBRARIES. BASED ON VISITS TO SIX LIBRARIES AND ATTENDANCE AT THE ANNUAL
CONFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE ON EAST ASIAN LIBRARIES. THE CHIEF PROBLEM IN THE
U.S.A. IS LACK OF FINANCE, WHICH AFFECTS ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,
AND STORAGE, WITH CONSEQUENT DELAYS IN PROCESSING AND CATALOGUING ACTIVITIES.
ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS INITIATION OF ATTRACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
TO ATTRACT FINANCE, AND USE OF VOLUNTARY STUDENT LABOUR, ARE DESCRIBED.
GREATER COOPERATION SEEMS ESSENTIAL, AND IT IS PROPOSED THAT A PROGRAMME OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN U.S. AND PARIS LIBRARIES SPECIALISING IN CHINESE MATERIAL
BE IMPLEMENTED.
