NATIONAL NEEDS FOR CRITICALLY EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA.
     
RELIABLE VALUES OF NUMERICAL DATA THAT EXPRESS IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS THE
PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY AND ARE NEEDED TO ARRIVE AT VALID DECISIONS WHENEVER A
GOVERNMENTAL OR INDUSTRIAL DECISION INVOLVES ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY. THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CONTAINS MANY VALUABLE DATA COVERING A
WIDE RANGE OF DIVERSE FIELDS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALSO CONTAINS MANY ERRONEOUS
VALUES. A SUBSTANTIAL INTELLECTUAL EFFORT IS A REQUIRED TO SELECT RELIABLE
VALUES FROM THE TOTAL OF THOSE REPORTED. FOR THIS REASON, A NUMBER OF
SPECIALISED DATA CENTRES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO COMPILE AND EVALUATE DATA IN
A SYSTEMATIC FASHION.
