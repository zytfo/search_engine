BIBLIO-DATA' THE DATA BANK AT THE GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY.

BIBLIO-DATA HAS DEVELOPED SINCE 1975 INTO THE BIGGEST LITERATURE DATA BANK FOR
ON-LINE SEARCHING IN WEST GERMANY. BY DEC 81 IT WAS LINKED TO 66 INSTITUTIONS
IN GERMANY AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND HAD ACCESS VIA THE STAIRS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TO EURONET DIANE. OVER 900,000 DOCUMENTARY UNITS ARE
AVAILABLE AND 100,000 ARE ADDED ANNUALLY. THE DATA BANK AIMS TO INCLUDE
REFERENCES TO ALL NEW GERMAN MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS, ALTHOUGH NOT TO
PERIODICAL ARTICLES, AND RETRIEVAL IS POSSIBLE VIA ALL IMPORTANT DATA
ELEMENTS. IN SERVICE QUALITY AND QUANTITY BIBLIO-DATA IS AHEAD OF MOST PRINTED
BIBLIOGRAPHIES; A SPECIAL FEATURE IS A LARGE STORE OF DISSERTATIONS FROM BOTH
EAST AND WEST GERMANY. CORRECTIONS, HOWEVER, CANNOT YET BE MADE AND SOME
ASPECTS OF CATALOGUING REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT.
