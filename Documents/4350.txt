MEASURES OF CONSISTENCY IN INDEXING' INTERCONSISTENCY.
     
REPORT OF A BRAZILIAN STUDY BASED ON POSTGRADUATE COURSE WORK IN INFORMATION
SCIENCE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE CONSISTENCY OF PERFORMANCE BY A GROUP OF
INDEXERS IN SELECTING TERMS TO REPRESENT DOCUMENT CONTENT. A PRELIMINARY
DISCUSSION EXAMINES PREVIOUS STUDIES OF CONSISTENCY AND FORMULAS DEVELOPED TO
TEST AND MEASURE BOTH INTER AND INTRACONSISTENCY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
METHODOLOGY USED HERE IN A RESTRICTED STUDY INVOLVING 10 INDEXERS AND 1
ARTICLE, AND RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL, SHOWING THE NUMBER OF TERMS ASSIGNED
IN RELATION TO LENGTH OF TIME SPENT; CONSISTENCY BETWEEN TERMS; AND FREQUENCY
OF USE OF TERMS. THE CONCLUSIONS INDICATE THE NEED FOR VOCABULARY RESTRICTION
OR PRESCRIPTION OF TERMS TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM OF INDEXER SUBJECTIVITY.
