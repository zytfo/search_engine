THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARIES' BOOK PURCHASES.

FACED WITH CUTS IN BOOK BUDGETS, LIBRARIANS HAVE TO CHOOSE TO WHICH GROUPS OF
USERS THEY SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY' THOSE WHO USE THE LIBRARY MOST, I.E. THOSE
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, OR THE MINORITY FOR WHOM THE NEED FOR MEANINGFUL
ACTIVITIES BEYOND TV AND WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN A TIME OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS GREAT.
FEARS THAT CUTS ARE MADE, NOT IN THE PULP ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE BUT IN
BOOKS BY QUALITY AUTHORS. INSTEAD OF DEFENDING WHAT IS CULTURALLY VALUABLE,
LIBRARIANS GIVE IN TO POPULAR DEMAND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH LOAN FIGURES.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARY PURCHASES
DEMONSTRATES THIS' WELL REVIEWED QUALITY BOOKS ARE BOUGHT IN SMALL NUMBERS,
WHEREAS MULTIPLE COPIES ARE BOUGHT OF ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE, DESPITE
LUKEWARM REVIEWS.
