NMA, APRIL 1980, NEW YORK: A PERSONAL VIEW.

PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE NATIONAL MICROGRAPHICS ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE AND
EXPOSITION, NEW YORK, APR 80. THE CONFERENCE THEME WAS 'FOCUS ON
PRODUCTIVITY', ALTHOUGH IT WAS FELT THAT SOME SESSIONS HAD LITTLE RELEVANCE TO
THE THEME. SPECIAL INTEREST SUBJECTS WERE ALSO COVERED-COMPUTER-RELATED
SESSIONS, BANKING/FINANCE SESSIONS AND INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY SESSIONS.
DELEGATES WERE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY THAN ARE THEIR
UK COUNTERPARTS. THE EXPOSITION ATTRACTED ABOUT 150 EXHIBITORS. THE PRIME
INTEREST WAS IN COM, AND THE EXHIBITION WAS LESS GIMMICKY THAN EXPECTED.
BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE ACCESS SYSTEM M, ON DISPLAY AT THE EXHIBITION.
