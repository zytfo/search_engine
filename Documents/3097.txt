NOTES ON 'LIBRARY, SCHOOL, READING'.
     
DISCUSSION OF THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN RELATION TO THE SCHOOL IN ITALY. WITH
GROWING ACCEPTANCE THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD PROMOTE CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AS WELL AS MAKE BOOKS AVAILABLE, THE LACK OF ANY COHERENT ORGANISATIONAL
STRUCTURE AT NATIONAL OR LOCAL LEVEL COORDINATING ACTIVITIES IN THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN BECOMES VERY NOTICEABLE, PARTICULARLY WHERE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ARE
CONCERNED IN PROMOTING READING HABITS. THE SITUATION AT PRESENT IS ONE OF
REPRESSED RIVALRY, WHERE ROLES ARE UNDEFINED. THE DIVERGENT ATTITUDES OF
TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED, WITH REFERENCE TO READING IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE SPREAD OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA.
