BEYOND CARNEGIE' THE LIBRARIAN AS COMMUNITY ACTIVIST.
     
THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY, AND IN
CANADA, DESPITE A TIGHTENING OF THE MONEY SUPPLY, PUBLIC LIBRARIES CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE COMMUNITY SERVICES, WITH A CHANGE IN OUTLOOK FROM LIBRARIES AS BOOK
REPOSITORIES TO LIBRARIES AS TOTAL INFORMATION SOURCES. DESCRIBES SOME
CANADIAN LIBRARY SERVICES OFFERING A RANGE OF INFORMATION AND ACTIVITIES FROM
YOGA CLASSES TO MOTORCYCLE CLUBS. IF LIBRARIES FAIL TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN
PROVIDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION, OTHERS WILL ASSUME THAT ROLE.
