REPORT ON THE FEASIBILITY STUDY AND PILOT PROJECT FOR A DIRECTORY OF SOURCES
OF TECHNICAL DIGESTS.
     
PROJECT DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF A DIRECTORY OF SOURCES OF TECHNICAL
DIGESTS (I.E. STATE OF THE ART REVIEWS) AND THE EFFORT AND COST REQUIRED TO
COMPILE IT, AS WELL AS ATTITUDES OF EXPERTS IN APPROPRIATE FIELDS TOWARDS IT.
RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE NO MAJOR OBSTACLES TO PRODUCING SUCH A PUBLICATION
BUT CASTS DOUBTS ON WHETHER IT WOULD ATTRACT SUFFICIENT DEMAND TO JUSTIFY THE
COSTS INVOLVED.
