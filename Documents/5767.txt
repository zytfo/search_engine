IMPLEMENTATION OF A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (S&T) INFORMATION DELIVERY
SYSTEM IN NEBRASKA, A LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED, AND AN
IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMME WAS DEVELOPED WITH EMPHASIS ON S&T INFORMATION
FOR THE LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH STAFF. TO ADDRESS THE DELIVERY OF S&T INFORMATION
INTO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, PROTOTYPE DATA BASES ON CERTAIN S&T TOPICS WHICH
RECEIVED SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION WERERE CREATED THROUGH THE USE OF
EXISTING COMPUTER COMPATIBILITY.
