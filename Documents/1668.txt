THE FINNISH WAY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. THE METROPOLITAN AREA CONSISTING OF HELSINKI,
ESPOO, VANTAA, AND KAUNIAINEN CITIES HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATIVE
LIBRARY AUTOMATION. THE CITY LIBRARIES ARE AIMING AT ESTABLISHING JOINT DATA
SYSTEMS AND DATA BASES, WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR INDEPENDENCE AS LOCAL
GOVERNMENT UNITS. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL AND BOOK FILE UPDATING
SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY OPERATIONAL; THE CATALOGUING SYSTEM WILL BE STARTED ONCE A
NATIONAL DECISION REGARDING CENTRALISED LIBRARY SERVICES HAS BEEN MADE; AND
THE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS DUE TO COMMENCE IN SPRING 81.
