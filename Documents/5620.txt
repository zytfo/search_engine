EVALUATION OF THE COLOMBIAN INSTITUTE OF CULTURE (COLCULTURA)'S EXPERIMENTAL
PROGRAMME OF PUBLIC-SCHOOL LIBRARIES.

REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT BY THE COLUMBIAN INTERAMERICAN SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP, EVALUATING A 4-YEAR TRIAL IN 4 CITIES BEGUN IN 1972, TO
ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE PROGRAMME. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, AND A SUMMARY OF RESULTS PRESENTED, COVERING SUCH
POINTS AS USER ATTITUDES AND SATISFACTION; INTEGRATION WITH SCHOOL CURRICULA;
AND ADEQUACY OF COLLECTIONS, PERSONNEL, AND SERVICES. FROM THESE, IT WAS
CONCLUDED THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES WERE DEFICIENT,
RESULTING IN INADEQUATE LIBRARY INTEGRATION INTO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES;
TRAINING FOR THE LIBRARIANS INVOLVED IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AS A PRIMARY
MEASURE TOWARDS IMPROVING THE PROJECT IF IT IS TO BE USED AS A MODEL FOR
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.
