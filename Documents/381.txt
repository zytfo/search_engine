CLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTATION ON GLUING AND GLUES USING UDC. PRACTICAL
RECOMMENDATIONS.

CLASSIFICATION OF LITERATURE CONTAINING INFORMATION ON GLUES AND GLUING IS A
DIFFICULT TASK AS THERE ARE SEVERAL CLASSES WITHIN THE UDC SYSTEM WITH ALMOST
IDENTICAL MEANING. THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN CHEMISTRY CARRIED OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE UDC
CLASSES AVAILABLE FOR CLASSIFICATION OF GLUES AND GLUING PROCESSES AND
PREPARED RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO USE THE UDC SYSTEM FOR CLASSIFICATION OF
GLUES AND GLUING. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED.
