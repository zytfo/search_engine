NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES IN SUBJECT COMMUNICATION AND
DOCUMENTATION' ECONOMY, COSTS, FINANCE AND ORGANISATION.

ON-LINE SERVICES AND SCREEN DISCS ARE PROMINENT AMONG NEW TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS IN WEST GERMANY AND ARE USED MAINLY BY SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. THEIR USE HAS RESULTED IN AN ECONOMIC TREND TOWARDS
COOPERATION BETWEEN SIMILAR FIRMS OR ORGANISATIONS OR BETWEEN COMPLEMENTARY
BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY. THE ON-LINE MARKET IS INTERNATIONALLY ORIENTED AND THE
MARKET LEADERS ARE MAINLY FROM ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES. THE ON-LINE
INFORMATION MARKET HAS DEVELOPED MORE SLOWLY IN WEST GERMANY THAN IN
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THIS SHOULD INCLUDE' DEVELOPING
INFORMATION POLICY WITH REGARD FOR ECONOMIC ASPECTS; ENCOURAGING COOPERATION
BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS AND USERS; AND CONCENTRATING THE RESTRICTED SUPPLY OF
GOVERNMENT MONEY SO AS TO FAVOUR THE GROWTH OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
