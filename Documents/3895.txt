SPECIFICATION AND UNCONSTRAINED ENUMERATION OF CONFORMATIONS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURES FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION.
     
A SYMMETRY GROUP CALLED THE CONFORMATION SYMMETRY GROUP (CFSG) WHICH PROVIDES
A METHOD OF UNIQUELY SPECIFYING MOLECULAR CONFORMATION BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE
DISCRETE BOND PROPERTY (SUCH AS ROTAMERIC STATE) IS FORMULATED. THE METHOD IS
APPLICABLE TO ENTIRE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AS WELL AS SUBSTRUCTURES. THE CFSG
CAN BE USED TO BUILD A SIMPLE 'ACYCLIC' CONFORMATION GENERATOR AND LEADS TO A
SOLUTION FOR A HERETOFORE UNSOLVED PROBLEM IN CONFORMATION ENUMERATION.
