LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTIONS' ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG TERM EFFECTS.
     
THE RECOGNITION BY LIBRARIANS OF THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING
LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTION IS STEADILY INCREASING, AS EVIDENCED BY REPORTS IN THE
LITERATURE. HOWEVER, MUCH WORK HAS YET TO BE DONE WHICH USES SOPHISTICATED
EVALUATION TECHNIQUES. REPORTS THE FOLLOW-UP OF AN EARLIER STUDY BY EXAMINING
THE LONG-TERM RETENTION OF LIBRARY-USE SKILLS. THROUGH USE OF PRETESTING AND
POSTTESTING, CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL
COMPARISONS, MULTIPLE REGRESSION, AND OTHER TECHNIQUES, CONCLUDES THAT
LONG-TERM POSSESSION OF LIBRARY-USE SKILLS IS MORE HIGHLY RELATED TO
LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTION THAN TO EITHER INHERENT INTELLECTUAL ABILITY OR
ACADEMIC DILIGENCE. IN ADDITION, DISCUSSES THE APPROPRIATENESS OF QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE METHODS OF EVALUATION AND CAUTION AGAINST TAKING FOR GRANTED
THE EFFECTIVE USE OF EVALUATION.
