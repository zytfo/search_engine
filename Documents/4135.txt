LIBRARY SERVICE FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE' ARENAS, PLAYERS AND STAKES.
     
LIBRARIES ARE 1 OF MANY ARENAS IN WHICH THE RIGHTS OF THE HANDICAPPED ARE

PROGRAMME OF SERVICES BUT THE SERVICES MUST DIFFERENTIATE THE NEEDS OF THE
VARIOUS TYPES OF HANDICAP. A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES AND OTHER AGENCIES IS
TACKLING THE PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION POVERTY AND ISOLATION AND ENCOURAGING A
SHIFT FROM ATTITUDES OF PATRONAGE TO THOSE OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
