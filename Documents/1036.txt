SERIALS EDUCATION IN MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS IN ACCREDITED LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN
THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.

(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS SENT TO THE
DIRECTORS OF THE 68 US AND CANADIAN ACCREDITED LIBRARY SCHOOLS, CONCERNING
COURSES ON SERIALS ACQUISITION, COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT, CONTROL, CATALOGUING,
AND CLASSIFICATION. 9 TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WERE HELD WITH THE TEACHERS OF SUCH
COURSES TO IDENTIFY THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES. THE 56 QUESTIONNAIRE
RESPONSES SHOWED THAT LESS ATTENTION WAS PAID TO SERIALS CONTROL THAN TO OTHER
SERIALS-RELATED TOPICS AND THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TEACHING
OF CONCEPTS IN SEPARATE AND NON-SEPARATE SERIALS COURSES.
