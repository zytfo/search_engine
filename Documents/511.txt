FOR GOOD OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.

LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THEIR RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHER
INVENTIVE NOR INNOVATIVE, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVEN
A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN
LOGIC.
