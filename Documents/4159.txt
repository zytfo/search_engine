LIBRARY USE AS A LEISURE ACTIVITY.
     
INTRODUCTORY SPEECH TO THE STUDY SESSION OF THE WORKING PARTY FOR COUNTY
LIBRARY SYSTEMS, NOORDWIJKERHOUT, 1 SEPT 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE RISE IN
LIVING STANDARDS SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INCREASE IN LEISURE
TIME. IN ADDITION THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DEVOTES A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS
INCREASED PURCHASING POWER TO ACQUIRING PRIVATE COMFORTS. WHEREAS BEFORE THE
WAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLED
BY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATE
CAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT AS
A SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWN
COLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEW
LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION CENTRES.
