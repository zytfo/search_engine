THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND SOCIAL DEMAND IN BRAZIL.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT A 1978 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE DISCUSSING THE FAILURE OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO BECOME AN ACCEPTED COMMUNITY INSTITUTION. CONSIDERS THEIR
ACTUAL STATE AT PRESENT' HOUSED IN SUBSTANDARD BUILDINGS, UNDER-RESOURCED,
STAFFED BY UNTRAINED PERSONNEL, AND USED MAINLY BY STUDENTS. THE IMPORTED
MODEL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVING THE NEEDS OF ALL THE COMMUNITY IS
INAPPROPRIATE TO THE SOCIAL REALITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IS BASED
ON CLASS DIVISION. STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF POTENTIAL
DEMAND, BUT DESPITE RECENT EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AND THE GROWTH OF
PUBLISHING, THE POPULATION OF NON-USERS REMAINS CONSTANT, AND READING
CONTINUES TO BE AN ELITE LEISURE ACTIVITY. THE INITIATION OF A CULTURAL POLICY
TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF SOCIAL DEPENDENCE AND DEVELOP PLANS FOR SOCIETY AS A
WHOLE IS ADVOCATED.
