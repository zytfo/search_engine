EVALUATION OF THE WORKING OF A SPECIALISED DATA AUTOMATED INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR CHEMISTRY.
     
A SOVIET NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR CHEMISTRY, FTOR,
USES A SPECIALLY DEVELOPED DESCRIPTOR LANGUAGE WITH LEXICAL UNITS THAT ARE (1)
STRUCTURAL FRAGMENTS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS AND (2) THOSE CHEMICAL BONDS WHICH
CHANGE DURING REACTIONS. THE PRECISION OF RETRIEVAL WAS INVESTIGATED AND FOUND
TO DECREASE WHEN THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE WAS NOT USED PROPERLY.
