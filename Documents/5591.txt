AN INDIAN LIBRARIAN LOOKS AT THE PROGRESS OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN 1960S AND
1970S.

THE PERIOD IN QUESTION SAW A RAPID GROWTH IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WHICH
REACHED A PEAK AROUND 1974. LOCALISED LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS ABANDONED IN
FAVOUR OF COOPERATIVE NETWORKS AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS THE RISE OF THE
PHENOMENON OF ON-LINE DATA BASE REFERENCE SERVICES SUCH AS DIALOG.
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-MEDIA LEARNING
RESOURCES CENTRES. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION BECAME LESS HIERARCHICAL IN THE
EARLY 1970S WITH MORE TRADE UNION INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENCE. THE WORSENING
ECONOMIC SITUATION AFTER 1974 LEFT ITS MARK WITH THE DRYING UP OF LIBRARY
VACANCIES AND NOTICEABLE PRESSURE ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.
