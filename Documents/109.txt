FACING THE PUBLIC.

THE PROCESS OF BRINGING NONUSERS INTO THE LIBRARY IS BEST DONE THROUGH A
LIMITED APPROACH, IDENTIFYING THE LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND SHOWING THEIR
IMPORTANCE TO A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. SUGGESTS HOW A LIBRARY CAN REACH OUT
TO THE PARENTS OF 3 TO 5-YEAR-OLDS AND THEN IMPRESS AND APPEAL TO THE CHILDREN
ONCE THEY ARE IN THE LIBRARY. IF A CHILD IS SUFFICIENTLY MOVED, HE WILL IMPOSE
ON HIS PARENTS TO BRING HIM REGULARLY.
