AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO COVER MATERIALS FOR CLASS 'A' LIBRARY BINDING.

DESCRIBES RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY WHITMAN PRODUCTS, LTD., RHODE ISLAND, INTO
ALTERNATE APPROACHES TO COVER MATERIALS FOR CLASS 'A' LIBRARY BINDING (WHICH
IS ENDORSED BY THE US LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE). CLASS 'A' COVER MATERIALS
HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LIMITED TO GROUP F BUCKRAM, BUT MANY NON-WOVEN SUBSTRATES
ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING CELLULOSE FIBRES REINFORCED WITH A SYNTHETIC RESIN IN
LATEX FORM. THESE HAVE, HOWEVER, BEEN DEFICIENT IN THE BOOK'S SPINE AREA.
WHITMAN HAS WORKED WITH A TYPE II GRADE NON-WOVEN BASE WITH SPINE
REINFORCEMENT USING POLYESTER SCRIMS. IT IS FELT THAT THE NEW APPROACH OFFERS
SUFFICIENT ADVANTAGES TO JUSTIFY AN EFFORT BY BINDERIES AND OTHERS TO DEVELOP
THE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES TO MAKE THIS A VIABLE, PROFITABLE CLASS 'A'
LIBRARY BINDING ADHESIVE.
