PROBLEMS IN THE STANDARDISATION OF TITLE ENTRIES IN CATALOGUING NETWORKS.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRAL TITLE CATALOGUE FREE OF REDUNDANCIES, AND IN
WHICH TITLES WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONAL REFERENCES OCCUR ONLY ONCE, IS POSSIBLE
WITHIN A COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING NETWORK, WHERE THE WORK LOAD IS DISTRIBUTED
ONLY THROUGH STANDARDISATION OF THE ENTRY FORM. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE DETECTION
AND PREVENTION OF MULTIPLE REFERENCES IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. DESCRIBES THE
CURRENT STATUS OF NETWORK CATALOGUING IN WEST GERMANY, THE
MONOGRAPH-CATALOGUING NETWORKS IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA, BAVARIA, AND OCLC.
THE MORE INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WHICH THEREBY BECOME
APPARENT, REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFORM TITLE ENTRIES, TAKES INTO
ACCOUNT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DATA PROCESSING, SPECIFIC LIBRARY ASPECTS,
AND ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS. THUS CAN A REALISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF USING DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES BE ACHIEVED.
