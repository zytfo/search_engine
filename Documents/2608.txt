WHO'S AFRAID OF THE REBELLIOUS YOUNGSTERS OF TODAY?: OR, LIBRARIANS WERE ALSO
YOUNG ONCE.
     
IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF
HOOLIGANISM IN LIBRARIES CAUSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE NETHERLANDS. A NUMBER
OF CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN HELD ON THE SUBJECT AND IN SEVERAL AREAS WORKING
PARTIES HAVE BEEN FORMED TO STUDY THE PROBLEM. THROUGHOUT THE NETHERLANDS THE
NUMBER OF REGISTERED LIBRARY USERS BELOW THE AGE OF 18 HAS INCREASED BY 93%
FOLLOWING THE ABOLITION OF MEMBERSHIP CHARGES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE REPRESENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADULT
READERS AND SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO MAKE USE OF LIBRARIES BY
PROVIDING SPECIAL ROOMS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE MAY LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MEET THEIR
FRIENDS.
