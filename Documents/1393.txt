MICROFORM COPIES AND AACR2' A NOTE.

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION) DRAWS NO DISTINCTION
BETWEEN MICROFORMS WHICH CONSTITUTE ORIGINAL PUBLICATIONS AND MICROFORMS
ISSUED AS COPIES OF WORKS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED IN HARD COPY. THE US LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS IS REVERTING TO AACR 1 PRACTICE, WHEREBY THE 'BODY OF THE ENTRY'
DESCRIBES THE ORIGINAL HARD COPY VERSION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MICROFORM
VERSION APPEARING AS A NOTE. THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE DISCUSSED.
