PUBLIC AWARENESS IN RURAL LIBRARIES.

INCREASING THE PUBLIC'S AWARENESS OF A LIBRARY'S EXISTENCE AND SERVICES IS
VITAL IN ANY LIBRARY COMMUNITY. IN US RURAL AREAS THERE ARE MANY MEANS OF
COMMUNICATION AT THE LIBRARIAN'S DISPOSAL, INCLUDING THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER,
LOCAL RADIO, WORD-OF-MOUTH COMMUNICATIONS BY LIBRARY STAFF, THE COUNTY BOARD
OF EDUCATION, AND SERVICE CLUBS. ONLY THROUGH COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC
CAN THE RURAL PUBLIC LIBRARY INCREASE ITS CIRCULATION AND FUNDING.
