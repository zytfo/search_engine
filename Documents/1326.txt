CULTURE IN HEDEMORA-A CHALLENGE.

DESCRIBES THE CULTURAL LIFE OF A SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITY, HEDEMORA (SWEDEN).
REMARKS ON THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE AS OUTLINED IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMME, WHERE
THE DREAMS ARE PUT FORWARD, AND WARNS AGAINST EXPANDING IT INTO ABSURDITY.
DIVIDES THE CONCEPT INTO' POPULAR AND AMATEUR CULTURE, NURTURED BY SOCIETIES
AND STUDY CIRCLES AND EXEMPLIFIED BY BIENNIAL ART EXHIBITIONS, AN ANTHOLOGY OF
POEMS, CRAFT DEMONSTRATIONS AND MUSICAL EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER; HIGH
CULTURE, AS REPRESENTED BY THE DRAMA, ART AND CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETIES AND THE
LIBRARY WHICH AIM TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE; AND CHILDREN'S CULTURE.
THIS ASPECT IS NEGLECTED AS THE LIBRARY HAS A POOR CHILDREN'S SECTION AND NO
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN.
