HEIGHTENING THE SCIENTIFIC POTENTIAL.
     
HEIGHTENING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MEANS IMPROVING THE WORK OF METHODOLOGICAL
CENTRES, (MCS). LIBRARY CENTRALISATION, 1974-80, WAS THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF
MCS AND CULTURAL AGENCIES. IN THE 11TH 5-YEAR-PLAN MCS MUST IMPROVE
CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS AS A UNIFIED INSTITUTION WHOSE STOCKS CAN FULFIL
ENHANCED PUBLIC DEMAND. IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY IN' LIBRARIANS' AND
READERS' BIBLIOGRAPHIC TRAINING; REFERENCE STOCK; FORMATION OF BOOKSTOCKS;
DISTRIBUTION OF METHODOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS; MC COORDINATION. TO ASSIST
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS A SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL AID TO USSR
LIBRARIES IS NEEDED. A DOCUMENT WILL SHORTLY APPEAR CONCERNING PROGRESSIVE
METHODS OF WORK IN LIBRARIES AND MCS. COORDINATION OF MCS IN THE USSR LIBRARY
SYSTEM AIMS FOR BETTER RESULTS IN METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR LIBRARIES.
