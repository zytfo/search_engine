ANSWER-PASSAGE RETRIEVAL BY TEXT SEARCHING.
     
PASSAGE RETRIEVAL (ALREADY OPERATIONAL FOR LAWYERS) HAS ADVANTAGES IN OUTPUT
FORM OVER REFERENCE RETRIEVAL AND IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. PREVIOUS
EXPERIMENTS IN PASSAGE RETRIEVAL FOR SCIENTISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED RECALL AND
FALSE RETRIEVAL RATES AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THOSE OF PRESENT REFERENCE
RETRIEVAL SERVICES. THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT INVOLVED A GREATER VARIETY OF FORMS
OF RETRIEVAL QUESTION. IN ADDITION, SEARCH WORDS WERE SELECTED INDEPENDENTLY
BY 2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR EACH RETRIEVAL QUESTION. THE SEARCH WORDS SELECTED,
IN COMBINATION WITH THE COMPUTER PROCEDURES USED FOR PASSAGE RETRIEVAL,
PRODUCED AVERAGE RECALL RATIOS OF 72 AND 67%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 2
SELECTORS. THE FALSE RETRIEVAL RATES WERE (EXCEPT FOR 1 PREDICTABLY DIFFICULT
QUESTION) RESPECTIVELY 13 AND 10 FALSELY RETRIEVED SENTENCES PER ANSWER-PAPER
RETRIEVED.
