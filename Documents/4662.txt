PLANNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
A SCHOOL LIBRARY IS A LIBRARY FIRST AND FOREMOST AND MUST ALLOW THE SMOOTH
PROCEDURE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING SUITED TO USERS'
NEEDS. A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OLDER SCHOOL BUILDINGS IS THE LOCATION OF A
CENTRALLY SITUATED ROOM OF SUITABLE SIZE. CAREFUL PRELIMINARY PLANNING BY
ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, LIBRARY AUTHORITIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND THE
ARCHITECT IS ESSENTIAL; THEY MUST ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE SCHOOL,
TEACHERS' REQUIREMENTS AND WHETHER THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL USE THE LIBRARY.
QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE BUILDING MATERIALS, FURNITURE, LIGHTING,
FLOORING AND COLOUR SCHEMES. THEN THE ARCHITECT CAN PREPARE PLANS FOR WHICH,
AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION, ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE.
