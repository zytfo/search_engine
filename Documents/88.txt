LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

A DECLINE IN THE UK BIRTH RATE, THE ASSUMPTION THAT FEW TEACHERS WOULD BE
NEEDED AND AN ATTEMPT TO BROADEN THE BASE OF EDUCATION HAVE LED TO THE
APPEARANCE OF COLLEGES AND INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION, FORMED AS MANY
COLLEGES OF EDUCATION CLOSED AND OTHERS MERGED WITH POLYTECHNICS AND OTHER
INSTITUTIONS. THE LIBRARIES ARE AS VARIED AS THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES, AND A
LACK OF PUBLISHED STANDARDS MAKES LIBRARY PLANNING DIFFICULT. WITH STAFF
DOUBLED OR TREBLED BY AMALGAMATIONS THERE IS A PARAMOUNT NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL
STAFF TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF STAFF AND RESOURCES.
THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATING A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE COUNTRY'S
WORKFORCE IN THE CHES IS ENORMOUS.
