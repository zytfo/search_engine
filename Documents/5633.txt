A STUDY OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF USERS OF THE SERVICES OF A SPECIAL LIBRARY.

REPORT OF AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT AT THE BRAZILIAN NUCLEAR ENERGY
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (INSTITUTO DE PESQUISAS ENERGETICAS E NUCLEARES) IN 1979,
TO ESTABLISH REASONS FOR LOW USE OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES, FOR PLANNING AND REORGANISATION PURPOSES. A
PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF RECENT LITERATURE ON LIBRARY USER STUDIES IS PRESENTED.
DATA WAS COLLECTED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND FROM STATISTICAL RECORDS. RESULTS ARE
REPORTED IN FULL, GIVING DETAILS OF USER CHARACTERISTICS; HABITS OF LIBRARY
FREQUENTATION; USE OF SERVICES; USE OF LIBRARY PUBLICATIONS; AND THE INFLUENCE
OF USER TRAINING ON LIBRARY HABITS. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESES, THAT SERVICES WERE
NOT GEARED TO EXISTING USER HABITS ALTHOUGH ADEQUATE FOR RESEARCH NEEDS, AND
THAT PREVIOUS TRAINING INCREASED USE, WERE BORNE OUT. THE NEED TO PROMOTE
SERVICES IS EMPHASISED IN CONCLUSION.
