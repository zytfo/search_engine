THE CULTURAL APPRAISAL OF EFFORTS TO ALEVIATE INFORMATION INEQUITY.
     
SUGGESTS THAT ACTION TO ALLEVIATE INFORMATION INEQUITY SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE
PRINCIPLES OF CONTEXTUALISM, INCREMENTALISM, MOTIVATION OF INFORMATION USERS,
AND MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSORPTIVE PROCESS THAT IS UNIQUE TO EACH CULTURAL
GROUP. TO DO THIS, INFORMATION SERVICES SHOULD RECOGNIZE CULTURAL PLURALISM
AND THE NEED TO ELIMINATE INFORMATION POVERTY AS VIEWED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE
GROUPS BEING SERVED.
