MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXCHANGE' A HOSPITAL VANTAGEPOINT.

IN AUTUMN 79, A STUDY OF THE MLA EXCHANGE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, TO DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TITLES
REQUESTED WERE ACTUALLY RECEIVED AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR TRANSACTIONS TO BE
COMPLETED BETWEEN DONOR AND RECIPIENT. EXPLAINS THE STUDY PROCEDURE. IT WAS
FOUND THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE TITLES REQUESTED WERE RECEIVED, COMPARABLE TO
ANOTHER STUDY REPORTED IN 1977. A MEDIAN OF FROM 26.4 TO 27.5 DAYS BETWEEN
REQUEST AND RECEIPT FOR ACADEMIC AND HOSPITAL DONORS RESPECTIVELY, WAS
ACHIEVED. DISCUSSES THE EXCHANGE IN GENERAL, ALTERNATE MEANS OF ACQUIRING
MISSING ISSUES, AND AIM VERSUS NON-AIM TITLES OFFERED BY DONORS.
