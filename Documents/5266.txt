THE NORTHWESTERN AFRICANA PROJECT' AN EXPERIMENT IN DECENTRALIZED
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND AUTHORITY CONTROL.

THE NORTHWESTERN AFRICANA PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A SYSTEM OF
DECENTRALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIC-CONTROL CENTRES COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR
BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE, CONSISTENT NATIONAL DATA BASE FOR USE IN A NATIONAL
LIBRARY NETWORK. UTILISING FUNDING GRANTED BY THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE
HUMANITIES AND BY THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, ILLINOIS,
SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT A HIGH-QUALITY DATA BASE, THAT IS, ONE THAT CONFORMS TO
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGUING STANDARDS AND HEADING USAGE, COULD BE PREPARED
AND MAINTAINED AT A LOCATION REMOTE FROM LC. THE DATA BASE WOULD BE
TRANSMITTED TO A CENTRAL LOCATION FOR INCORPORATION INTO A COMMON DATA BASE
AND FOR DISTRIBUTION.
