BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION.

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN
BROADER BASED JOURNALS.
