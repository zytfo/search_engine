TRANSLATION AND ARABIZATION OF THE ANGLO AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (IN
ARABIC).
     
THE JORDAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARAB LEAGUE
EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL, AND SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION (ALECSO), HAS BEGUN THE
TRANSLATION AND ARABIZATION OF AACR 2 WHICH IT IS HOPED WILL BE FINISHED IN
MID 1982. THIS WILL BE A STEP TOWARDS THE STANDARDISATION OF CATALOGUING,
CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT HEADINGS, THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH HAS BEEN
EMPHASISED BY MANY LIBRARY CONFERENCES IN ARABIC COUNTRIES SINCE 1959. THE
TRANSLATED EDITION WILL INCLUDE ARABIC EXAMPLES, SUITABLE FOR THE ARAB WORLD,
IN ADDITION TO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEALING WITH PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT ARAB
CATALOGUERS AND BIBLIOGRAPHERS FACE.
