CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN RESEARCH WORK WITH NEWSPAPER COLLECTIONS.
     
USE OF THE NEWSPAPER DEPARTMENT OF THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS MORE THAN
DOUBLED OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS. IN SUCH AN EXPANDING FIELD OF LIBRARIANSHIP
THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE ESTABLISHING A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE
ORGANISATION AND USE OF NEWSPAPERS. PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH CAN BE
READILY IDENTIFIED. IN 1978 THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY ORGANISED A CONFERENCE ON
THE SUBJECT AS THE 1ST STEP IN A LONG-TERM PROGRAMME TO SET UP A
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE CENTRE FOR WORK WITH NEWSPAPER COLLECTIONS.
