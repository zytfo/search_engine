A STUDY OF INTER-LIBRARY LENDING AT THE SUHL DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY.
     
IN THE LAST 3-4 YEARS 5,000 BOOK ORDERS WERE PROCESSED ANNUALLY BY THE SUHL
DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY. THESE INCLUDE ALL THE ORDERS WHICH WERE PLACED AT
OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT. BETWEEN 40%-50% OF ORDERED BOOKS CAN NOW BE
PROVIDED FROM THE LIBRARY STOCK AT THE RESEARCH LIBRARY. THE BOOK STOCK HAS
GROWN FROM 25,000 IN 1961 TO 205,000 IN 1979. IN 1966 A WEEKLY COURIER SERVICE
WAS INTRODUCED TO IMPROVE INTER-LIBRARY LENDING. THE SUHL COURIER SERVICE
OPERATES BETWEEN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF GERMAN CLASSICS, WEIMAR, THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, JENA AND BACK TO THE RESEARCH LIBRARY. ON AVERAGE 50% OF
BOOKS ORDERED COULD BE SUPPLIED IN UNDER 10 DAYS USING THE COURIER SERVICE.
