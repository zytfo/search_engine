COMMUNITY WORKERS AND INFORMATION' FROM NATIONAL RESOURCES TO NEIGHBOURHOOD
ADVICE.
     
THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF COMMUNITY WORKERS IN THE UK ARE EXAMINED FROM
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ORGANISATIONAL AND PERSONAL RESTRAINTS WHICH AFFECT
THEM. SOME LOCAL POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED BY COMMUNITY
WORKERS WHEN OBTAINING AND USING INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED AS WELL AS SOME
LIMITATIONS IMPOSED THROUGH WORKING WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS. 3 APPROACHES TO
COMMUNITY WORKER INVOLVEMENT WITH NEIGHBOURHOOD INFORMATION CENTRES AND THE
MISCONCEPTION UNDERLYING THEM ARE IDENTIFIED. A FRESH APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO
PROVISION OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTRE AND REGIONAL RESOURCE CENTRES FOR
USE BY COMMUNITY WORKERS.
