A VIEW FROM BRAZIL.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LIBRARY PLANNING IN BRAZIL
INCLUDE ITS LARGE SIZE, ITS VERY YOUNG POPULATION, ITS STRUGGLING
SEMI-INDUSTRIALISED ECONOMY, THE UNEVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND LOW LEVELS OF
RESEARCH ACTIVITY AND PUBLISHING OUTPUT. MODERNISATION MEANS THAT THE DEMAND
FOR DOCUMENTS IS POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE. DOCUMENT SUPPLY WILL BE ORGANISED
THROUGH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC OR ADMINISTRATIVE SECTORS, SUCH AS AGRICULTURE,
ENERGY, OR EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THESE WILL NEED TO BE COORDINATED TO AVOID GAPS
OR UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION IN SUBJECT COVERAGE, AND SOME DEGREE OF
CENTRALISATION IS DESIRABLE.
