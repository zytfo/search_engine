SERIAL ACQUISITION AS A CAPITAL BUDGETING PROBLEM.
     
EXAMINES THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PURCHASING PERIODICALS ON A 1-YEAR VERSUS A
3-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. THE DECISION PROBLEM IS VIEWED AS A CAPITAL
BUDGETING PROBLEM WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS COST MINIMISATION OVER A 6-YEAR TIME
SPAN. THE VARIABLES CONSIDERED CRITICAL TO THE DECISION INCLUDE COST OF
CAPITAL, SUBSCRIPTION REORDER COST FACING THE LIBRARY, ANNUAL RATE OF CHANGE
OF SUBSCRIPTION RATES, AND RATIO OF 3-YEAR TO 1-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION COSTS. THE
MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AND APPLIED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LIBRARY MANAGERS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER. RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT, EVEN UNDER THOSE
CONDITIONS MOST FAVOURABLE TO MAINTAINING A 1-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION POLICY,
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS CAN ACCRUE BY SHIFTING TO A 3-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION POLICY.
