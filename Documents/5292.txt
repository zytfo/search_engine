AIDS TO LIBRARIES IN THE PURCHASE OF MEDICAL PERIODICALS.

10 BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF MEDICAL PERIODICALS ARE DESCRIBED, NOT ALL SUITABLE FOR
GERMAN MEDICAL LIBRARIES. A METHOD WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE CITATION FREQUENCY
OF PERIODICALS FOR FINDING OUT THE BASIC IMPORTANT PERIODICALS. A COMPARISON
WAS MADE BETWEEN REQUESTS FOR PERIODICALS FROM ULM AND COLOGNE AND A LIST OF
AN INTERNATIONAL RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS MADE. THE NEW LIST IS CONSIDERED TO BE
AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO A MEDICAL LIBRARY'S BASIC NEEDS; ALL EXCEPT THE
SMALLEST HOSPITAL LIBRARIES WOULD REQUIRE LARGER STOCKS. THE NUMBER OF CURRENT
PERIODICALS TAKEN BY A LIBRARY SHOULD DEPEND ON' THE NUMBER OF READERS AND
REQUESTS; AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PERIODICALS.
