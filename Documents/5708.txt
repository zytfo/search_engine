GANGS OF SAVERS IN A DANCE OF CRANES.

4 MEMBERS OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S WORKING PARTY ON SAVINGS WERE ASKED TO
EVALUATE THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE. THEY
DISCUSSED THE FIGURES RELATING TO RUNNING COSTS, STAFF AND MATERIAL COSTS
PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND THE EFFECTS OF CUTS ON WORK LOADS AND
LOANS. VIEWS DIFFERED AS TO WHETHER MINIMUM NORMS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN. THEY
AGREED THAT THE UNION AS A CENTRAL ORGANISATION COULD DO LITTLE TO GIVE
GUIDELINES FOR ACTION IN LOCAL SITUATIONS. SOME THOUGHT MEMBERS SHOULD REFUSE
TO TAKE PART IN LOCAL WORKING GROUPS ON SAVINGS SET UP TO GIVE PRIORITIES TO
CUTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS, AS THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO CONDONING CUTS, OTHERS
THOUGHT USEFUL INFORMATION COULD BE GAINED FROM PARTICIPATION AND THAT LOCAL
LIBRARIANS SHOULD PRESENT POLITICANS WITH WELL ARGUED BUDGET PROPOSALS AND
OUTLINE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR CUTS.
