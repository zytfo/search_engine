CRITICISM OF BOURGEOIS LIBRARIANSHIP IN SOVIET LIBRARY LITERATURE.
     
PROVIDES A CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN WESTERN
COUNTRIES AS REFLECTED IN THE WRITINGS OF SOVIET LIBRARIANS. CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM 1920S AND 1930S REVEAL NOT ONLY CRITICISM OF THE WESTERN LIBRARY THEORIES
BUT ALSO APPRECIATION OF PRACTICAL ACHIEVEMENTS. INCONSISTENCY OF THEORY
(NON-POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF LIBRARIES) WITH PRACTICE (MIDDLE CLASS BIAS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WAS 1 OF THE MAIN AREAS OF CRITICISM IN THE 1940S AND 1950S.
1960S BROUGHT WIDER INTEREST IN SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE CURRENT INTEREST IS THE INFLUENCE OF WESTERN
LIBRARIANSHIP ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
