EXTEMPLO-REFLECTIONS ON A YEAR.
     
THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL VIA SCANNET, EXTEMPLO, COMPLETED ITS 2ND YEAR IN 1980.
IT DRAWS TOGETHER NOTES ON LECTURES, COURSES AND CONFERENCES ON SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES. ITS DECENTRALISED EDITING, BY LOCAL
EDITORS IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES, MAY BE A PRECURSOR TO THE
AUTHOR/EDITOR/REVIEWER COMMUNICATION IN FUTURE SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC JOURNALS.
EXTEMPLO IS ENTERED VIA A FAIRLY SIMPLE EDITING PROCEDURE INTO THE DEC10
COMPUTER AT GOTHENBURG'S MEDICINDATA. ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE GREATLY
INFLUENCED BY THE ONGOING CHANGES IN THE LONG DISTANCE TELECOMMUNICATION
NETWORK AVAILABLE IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES.
