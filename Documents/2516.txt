STANDARDISATION IN THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY' THE CURRENT
SITUATION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS.
     
STANDARDS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
THE IMPROVING OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. THEIR RELEVANCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP
INCLUDES IMPROVING READER SERVICES, MAXIMISING USE OF RESOURCES, ACCOUNTING
PROCEDURES AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION. IN 1976-78 EXISTING STANDARDS
RELATING TO LIBRARIES WERE REVISED AND COORDINATED AND A LONG-TERM PROGRAMME
OF STANDARDISATION COVERING INFORMATION WORK, LIBRARIANSHIP AND PUBLISHING WAS
INITIATED. ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AFFECTED BY STANDARDS INTRODUCED SINCE
THEN INCLUDE' THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC AND MAPS, REFERENCE
BOOKS IN SERVICE POINTS, BASIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
WORK, AND A SINGLE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS.
