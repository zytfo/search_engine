INTEGRATING MICROGRAPHICS WITH WORD PROCESSING.
     
IN 1974, THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (CRS) INSTALLED A WORD PROCESSING
(WP) SYSTEM TO MEET EXPANDING CONGRESSIONAL NEEDS. THE WP SYSTEM INCREASED
OUTPUT, STRAINING THE ABILITY OF CRS TO HANDLE ITS STORAGE NEEDS. PAPER WAS
USED FOR QUICK DISTRIBUTION OF EYE-READABLE MATERIALS, MAGNETIC TAPE FOR QUICK
RETRIEVAL OF MACHINE-READABLE STORAGE, AND MICROFORM FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.
MAINTAINING COMPATIBILITY AMONG THE 3 STORAGE SYSTEMS BECAME A FORMIDABLE
TASK, AND THE SOLUTION SEEMED TO BE TO INTEGRATE STORAGE TO 1 MEDIUM.
MICROFORMS OFFERED THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEETING THE TOTAL STORAGE
REQUIREMENTS.
