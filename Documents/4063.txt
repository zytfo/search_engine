ON THE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF THE LIBRARIAN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF EDUCATION
AND TRAINING.
     
SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEMS AIM TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE PEOPLE
IN ALL SUBJECTS, TO PROVIDE SOUND COMMUNIST TRAINING AND TO SUPPORT THE
FURTHER GROWTH OF SOCIALIST SOCIETY. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
MUST, THEREFORE, BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE OBJECTIVES. THE LIBRARIAN HAS A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION, TO FURTHER RESEARCH STUDY AND TO SUPPORT SOCIALIST EDUCATION.
WHATEVER BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK THE STUDENT WILL EVENTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN,
TRAINING SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO LEARNING FACTS AND LIBRARY METHODOLOGY
TECHNIQUES BUT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
ASPECTS OF LIBRARY WORK. A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE HIS PARTICULAR
SOCIAL ROLE IN HIS BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK TO THE SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A
WHOLE.
