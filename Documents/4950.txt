THE INVOLVEMENT OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES IN THE BOOK INDUSTRY IN BRAZIL.
     
TRANSLATION FROM ENGLISH. MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PROMINENT IN
BRAZIL IN ALL FIELDS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
CENTURY; THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLISHING BEGAN TO INCREASE NOTABLY WITH THE
EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AT THE END OF THE 1950S. THE PROGRESSIVE STAGES
OF GROWTH UP TO THE PRESENT ARE DESCRIBED, WITH DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS WAYS IN
WHICH SUCH COMPANIES HAVE PENETRATED THE BOOK INDUSTRY AND PROTECTIVE
LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NATIONAL COMPANIES. BRAZILIAN FIRMS ARE
MAINLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF CAPITAL; STRATEGIES USED TO CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEM
ARE DISCUSSED. THE MULTINATIONALS CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED IN BOOK PRODUCTION ARE
LISTED; MANY BRAZILIANS, HOWEVER, ARE INVOLVED IN THESE COMPANIES, WHILE SOME
MULTINATIONALS ARE COVERTLY INVOLVED IN NATIONAL COMPANIES. HENCE THE DIVISION
OF THE MARKET BETWEEN FOREIGN AND NATIONAL PRODUCERS IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE
EXACTLY.
