CONCEPTUAL DIMENSIONS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.

SUGGESTS A DESCRIPTIVE MODEL THAT WOULD INTERRELATE SOME FAMILIAR CONCEPTS OF
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT WITHIN A UNIFIED SYSTEM. THE APPROACH IS THEORETICAL,
CONCENTRATING ON A RELATIONAL NATURE OF CONCEPTUAL MANAGEMENT, DISTINGUISHING
IT FROM THE TRADITIONAL PRAGMATIC DEFINITION. THE MODEL ILLUSTRATES THE
3-DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION, ENCOMPASSING THE
PROCEDURAL-TECHNICAL, THE CONTEXTUAL-SERVICE ORIENTED, AND THE
CONCEPTUAL-THEORETICAL LEVELS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
