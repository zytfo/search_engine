THE CANADIAN PUBLIC ARCHIVES AND THE REPORT ENTITLED THE FUTURE OF THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA.
     
A SLIGHTLY CONDENSED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONGRESS
OF THE QUEBEC ARCHIVISTS' ASSOCIATION, BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
ESTABLISHED BY THE CANADIAN PUBLIC ARCHIVES TO REPLY TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
REPORT OF 1979. DEALS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE FOR TRANSFERRING MAPS,
MANUSCRIPTS AND MUSIC FROM THE PUBLIC ARCHIVES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY,
INSISTING ON THE RETENTION OF THE DIVISION OF MATERIAL BETWEEN THE 2
INSTITUTIONS ACCORDING TO PHYSICAL FORM, NOT SUBJECT MATTER. SHOWS HOW THE
PRESENT ARRANGEMENT CAME INTO BEING BY INTENTION, NOT ACCIDENT; THE
UNNECESSARY EXPENSE INVOLVED IN CREATING AN ARCHIVE SECTION AT THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY; AND THE IRRELEVANCE OF FOREIGN MODELS TO THE CANADIAN SITUATION.
REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE LEGISLATION CURRENTLY IN FORCE, AND THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY RECOMMENDATIONS FINALLY DISMISSED AS IMPRACTICAL AND ILL-CONCEIVED.
