NALNET BOOK SYSTEM' COST BENEFIT STUDY.
     
THE GOALS OF THE NASA'S LIBRARY NETWORK SYSTEM, NALNET, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE
CURRENT BOOK SYSTEM, THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF A BOOK SYSTEM REQUIRED BY
NASA CENTRE LIBRARIES, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BEST
SUPPLY THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE ASSESSED. EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON
DETERMINING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF MEETING NASA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR
AN AUTOMATED BOOK SYSTEM. VARIOUS OPERATING MODES WERE EXAMINED INCLUDING THE
CURRENT STIMS FILE, THE PUBFILE, DEVELOPING SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS
AS APPROPRIATE TO THE CENTRE NEEDS, AND OBTAINING CATALOGUING AND PRODUCTS
FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES INCLUDING AT LEAST OCLC, RLIN, BNA, AND STIF.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NALNET OPERATE UNDER THE STIMS FILE MODE AND OBTAIN
CATALOGUING AND PRODUCTS FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES.
