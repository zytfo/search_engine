SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY. (IV) RELIGIOUS CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY.

THE RANGE OF CASSETTES ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET IS
RELATIVELY SMALL. SOME RELIGIOUS MATERIAL IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON RECORDS, WHICH
ARE LESS USEFUL THAN CASSETTES IN LIBRARIES, BUT THE PRODUCTS OF A FEW
IMPORTANT MANUFACTURERS SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF A LIBRARY'S STOCK.
MANUFACTURERS' LISTS PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE LIBRARIAN
SINCE NO COMPREHENSIVE TOPICAL INDEX OF RELIGIOUS CASSETTES EXISTS. CASSETTE
MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY CONTAINING BIBLE READINGS AND DRAMATISATIONS,
TALKS ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH, THE CHRISTIAN WAY OF LIFE, MEDITATION AND PRAYER
IS DESCRIBED. EACH CASSETTE SHOULD BE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNING ITS
SUBJECT CONTENT, AIMS, SUITABILITY FOR THE TARGET GROUP AND THE QUALITY OF
MUSIC, LANGUAGE AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTION. (FOR PREVIOUS PARTS, SEE 82/5287,
82/5291 AND 82/5288).
