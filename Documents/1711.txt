THE LIBRARIES OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL OFFICES IN THE WORLD. COMMENTS ON
THE RESULTS OF AN ENQUIRY. PART 1.
     
AFTER OUTLINING THE HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARIES OF STATISTICAL
OFFICES AND CONSIDERING THEM ONE OF THE EARLIEST TYPES OF SPECIALISED LIBRARY,
THE RESULT OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL SURVEY IS PRESENTED WHICH WAS
CONDUCTED FOR THE 1ST TIME ON A WORLD-WIDE BASIS AT THE LIBRARIES OF NATIONAL
STATISTICAL OFFICES. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS IS FOLLOWED BY CONCLUSIONS
WITH REGARD TO A FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES
WITH A VIEW TO CREATING A WORLD-WIDE DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL. IN THE LIGHT OF
THESE ACTIVITIES, AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE FIELD OF ATOMIC RESEARCH, SUCH A
CONSIDERATION CAN IN NO WAY BE REGARDED AS AN ILLUSION. THIS SUGGESTION
REPRESENTS AT THE SAME TIME A PARTIAL PROGRAMME FOR FURTHER WORK TO BE
PERFORMED BY THE RELEVANT IFLA SECTION.
