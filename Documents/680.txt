ABOLITION OF CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES: YES OR NO?' THE OPINIONS OF LOCAL
COUNCILLORS.

TEXT OF A DISCUSSION WITH COUNCILLORS INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES IN 3 LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE COUNCILLOR
FROM RIJSWIJK, WHERE CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP WERE ABOLISHED ON 1
JAN 74, POINTED OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED BORROWERS HAD RISEN FROM
12,907 IN 1973 TO 21,183 IN 1974. HOWEVER, THE GROWTH IN MEMBERSHIP FIGURES
HAD LED TO INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE EXISTING SERVICES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT
HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO REDUCE LIBRARY OPENING HOURS FROM 47 1/2 HOURS TO 29
1/2 HOURS PER WEEK. THE UITHOORN AND HEERHUGOWAARD COUNCILLORS DEFENDED THE
POLICY OF THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS IN MAINTAINING CHARGES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY
WERE NOT EXCESSIVE.
