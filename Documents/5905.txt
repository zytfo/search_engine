RUDOLPH FOCKE AND THE THEORY OF THE CLASSIFIED CATALOG.

BETWEEN 1900 AND 1905, RUDOLPH FOCKE PUBLISHED A SERIES OF PAPERS ON
CLASSIFICATION THEORY AND A DRAFT OF CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIFIED
CATALOGUES. HIS WORK WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORM OF LIBRARIANSHIP
DURING THE LAST DECADES OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE LARGE NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WAS
SEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODE
MAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTO
THE 20TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIME
WHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
CLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INFLUENCED BY 19TH CENTURY GERMAN
CLASSIFICATION THAN HAS HERTOFORE BEEN RECOGNISED. RE PORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
