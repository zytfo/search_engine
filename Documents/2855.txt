CONSERVATION IN THE LIBRARY.
     
DURING RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CONCERN OVER THE PHYSICAL
CONDITION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. PAPER IS BRITTLE AND CRUMBLING, BINDINGS ARE
DISINTEGRATING, PRINT IS FADING AND COVERS ARE SOFT AND SPONGY. UNFORTUNATELY
RESTORATION IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. DISCUSSES THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES
IN THE LIBRARY AND THE MANY AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE
PROBLEMS. CLAIMS THAT CONSERVATION PROGRAMMES ARE SOMETIMES TREATED WITH
APATHY AND RESISTANCE DUE TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLACING PRIORITIES ON SERVICES.
CONCLUDES THAT RESTORATION WORK IS BEST LEFT TO PROFESSIONAL CONSERVATORS
WHILE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES CAN BE INSTITUTED BY DEDICATED LIBRARIANS.
