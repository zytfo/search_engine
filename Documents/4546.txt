THE MEDIA CENTRE IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL.
     
STUDENTS IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL WILL INCLUDE FORMER PUPILS OF BOTH
GRAMMAR AND SECONDARY MODERN SCHOOLS. SOME STUDENTS WILL BE ON PART TIME, SOME
ON FULL TIME COURSES; MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE HAD SOME WORK EXPERIENCE AND MANY
WILL HAVE PRACTICAL RATHER THAN ACADEMIC ABILITY. THE MEDIA CENTRE NEEDS A
WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECT MATERIAL FOR ALL ACADEMIC LEVELS. SELF-TEACHING
PROGRAMMES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA ARE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN
DEMONSTRATING THE OPERATION OF MACHINERY. SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE LEARNING
DIFFICULTIES AND A LACK OF MOTIVATION; PROVISION OF MATERIAL FOR LEISURE AS
WELL AS ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY, WHERE
THEY MAY FIND THEIR LAST CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOR EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS. THE MEDIA
CENTRE SHOULD ALSO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF JOB FLEXIBILITY.
