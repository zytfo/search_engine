REVIEWS 6 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY CONDUCTED AT THE 2 MAJOR
LIBRARIES OF CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO-THE SEARS LIBRARY (PHYSICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMICS) AND THE
FREIBERGER LIBRARY (SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES). THE
STUDIES SHOW HOW CERTAIN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS HAVE INFLUENCED BOOK
AVAILABILITY IN THESE LIBRARIES AND HOW CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, OVER WHICH
MANAGEMENT HAD LITTLE CONTROL, HAVE COMPROMISED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOOK
AVAILABILITY.
