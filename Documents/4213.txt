AD HOC SUBCOMMITTEE ON STAFFING REPORT TO THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF
THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION FOR VIRGINIA.
     
BECAUSE THE STAFFING FORMULA MANDATED BY VIRGINIA'S STATE COUNCIL OF HIGHER
EDUCATION YIELDED UNREALISTICALLY LOW NUMBERS OF LIBRARY PERSONNEL FOR THE
LARGER INSTITUTIONS AND FOR MULTI-CAMPUS COMMUNITY COLLEGES, THE SUBCOMMITTEE
ON STAFFING OF THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING A
MORE SUITABLE FORMULA. GENERALLY, THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THE BASIC
FORMULA DEVELOPED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COULD BE MODIFIED TO
SUIT THE PARTICULAR PERSONNEL NEEDS OF VIRGINIA'S ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND THAT
THE DEFINITIONS OF ALL FORMULA INPUT VARIABLES SHOULD BE REEXAMINED AND
CLARIFIED WHERE NECESSARY. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
