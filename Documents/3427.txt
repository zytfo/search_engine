TELESOFTWARE' PRESTEL INITIATIVE WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS.
     
PRESTEL HAS PROVIDED THE INITIAL IMPETUS FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICE AND HAS CAUSED A GREAT INCREASE IN THE

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION OF PROGRAMS AND DATA TO MICROCOMPUTERS) COULD BE 1 OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION FOR HOBBYISTS,
EDUCATION AND BUSINESS USERS. AFTER BRIEFLY DESCRIBING A TELESOFTWARE SYSTEM
DEVELOPED BY THE COUNCIL FOR EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, SUGGESTS HOW A REALISTIC
TELESOFTWARE SERVICE COULD EVOLVE ON PRESTEL.
