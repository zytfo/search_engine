SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN LOWER SAXONY.
     
LECTURE GIVEN TO THE CONFERENCE OF LIBRARIANS IN LOWER SAXONY, CELLE, APR 81.
SINCE 1979 THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRE IN HANOVER HAS PROVIDED CENTRALISED
PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ITS
AREA. THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RUN BY LIBRARIANS
OR TEACHERS IS STILL DISPUTED. SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN'
THE REFORMED GRAMMAR SCHOOL, WHERE THEY PROMOTE INDEPENDENT STUDY AND
COOPERATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PUPILS; SCHOOLS OPEN ALL DAY, WHERE THE
LIBRARY BECOMES A COMMUNICATION CENTRE CATERING FOR LEISURE AS WELL AS
ACADEMIC ACTIVITY; VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOLS, WHERE THEY CATER FOR STUDENTS
FROM ALL LEVELS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, PROVIDE SPECIAL HELP FOR FOREIGN
STUDENTS WITH LANGUAGE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP POSSIBILITIES FOR JOB FLEXIBILITY.
CLEAR, PREFERABLY BINDING, REGULATIONS ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NEEDED.
