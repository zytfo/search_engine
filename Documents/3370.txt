UNIFIED RULES ON KEYWORD CATALOGUING.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE AN
OFFENTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WEST
GERMANY, MAY 81. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE IDEA OF UNIFIED KEYWORD
CATALOGUING RULES FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND THE SUBJECT CATALOGUING COMMITTEE OF
THE DEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE) HAS RECENTLY
PRODUCED A REPORT ON THIS SUBJECT. SINCE SUBJECT CATALOGUING PROBLEMS HAVE
BEEN NEGLECTED FOR DECADES AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING CARRIED OUT BY MANY
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN THE WASTING OF WORK TIME, SUPER-REGIONAL
COOPERATION IN THIS SPHERE OFFERS ATTRACTIVE PROSPECTS. IF REGIONAL UNION
CATALOGUE SYSTEMS AND CENTRALISED SERVICES TOOK OVER ALL SUBJECT CATALOGUING,
RATIONAL RULES AND PROCEDURES WOULD RESULT. KEYWORD CATALOGUES ARE BECOMING
MORE AND MORE POPULAR AND THE CREATION OF UNIFIED RULES WILL DEMAND MORE
INTENSIVE WORK BY LIBRARIANS.
