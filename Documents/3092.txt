IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE' CONTACT BETWEEN BONN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY AND THE
HANDICAPPED.
     
THE LIBRARY LOANS BOOKS TO AND COMPILES BOOK-LISTS FOR A REHABILITATION CENTRE
FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND VARIOUS CLUBS WITH BOTH HANDICAPPED AND
NON-HANDICAPPED MEMBERS. CHILDREN FROM A LOCAL KINDERGARTEN FOR BOTH
HANDICAPPED AND NON-HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, HOPEFULLY A BASIS FOR FUTURE MIXED
SCHOOL CLASSES, VISIT THE LIBRARY REGULARLY. THE LOCAL SCHOOL FOR THE
PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED BRINGS GROUPS REGULARLY TO THE LIBRARY AND SUCCESSFUL
CLASSES HAVE BEEN HELD THERE FOR THEM TOGETHER WITH NON-HANDICAPPED CHILDREN.
THE LIBRARIAN GIVES GUIDANCE ON BOOKS DURING TRAINING COURSES FOR THE MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED AND GROUPS OF MENTALLY HANDICAPPED WILL BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE BOOKS
IN PEACE OUTSIDE NORMAL LIBRARY HOURS.
