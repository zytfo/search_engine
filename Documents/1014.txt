HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE
DEBATE BY G. RENBORG AND E. STARFELT.
