TEN YEARS' STRUGGLE GAVE A RESULT IN LORENSKOG: NEW PREMISES, GREAT INCREASE
IN LOANS-NOW ONLY STAFF ARE LACKING.
     
LORENSKOG CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, WAS ESTABLISHED IN SCHOOL PREMISES IN 1967
AS A COMBINED PUBLIC/SCHOOL LIBRARY. FROM THE 1ST IT WAS TOO SMALL AND THE
COMBINATION PROVED UNSATISFACTORY. IN 1971 A REORGANISATION PLAN FOR THE
LIBRARY SERVICE INCLUDED A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
POSTPONEMENTS, WORSENING CONDITIONS AND STAFF PROTESTS, THE LIBRARY RENTED 650
SQ.M. IN A NEW OFFICE BLOCK-MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS EXISTING ACCOMMODATION,
THOUGH HALF THE SPACE PROPOSED IN 1971-AND OPENED THERE IN SUMMER 80. LOANS
HAVE RISEN BY 85%. LACK OF STAFF NECESSITATES A REDUCTION OF 9 HOURS PER WEEK
IN OPENING TIMES, AND PREVENTS ANY EXTENSION ACTIVITIES, BUT THE STAFF
INTENDED TO CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT FOR BETTER LIBRARY SERVICE.
