COMPARISON OF HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR AUTOMATIC
CLASSIFICATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
SEVERAL HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS METHODS WERE APPLIED TO A SET OF
BENZENOID COMPOUNDS BY USING STRUCTURAL FEATURES AUTOMATICALLY DERIVED FROM
WISWESSER LINE NOTATION. COMPARIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES IN CLASSIFICATION, DUE
TO CHOICE OF CLUSTERING ALGORITHM AND DATA STANDARDISATION TECHNIQUE, WERE
MADE.
