LEGIBILITY ASPECTS OF CODED ONLINE INFORMATION.
     
ON-LINE SERVICES PROVIDE HIGHLY STRUCTURED MATERIAL, LIKE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION, BUT NORMALLY NO SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPOGRAPHICAL LAYOUT. THE
INCREASING USE OF TEXTUAL DATA BASES MAKES IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE SOME
GENERALISED CODES INTO THE TEXT. THESE FLAGS ARE NEEDED TO ASSIST THE OUTPUT
DEVICE IN PRESENTING THE MATERIAL IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY ACCORDING TO THE
ACCEPTED RULES OF LEGIBILITY RESEARCH. THIS CODING SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAY EQUIPMENT. MODERN LEGIBILITY RESEARCH COVERING
TYPOGRAPHY, LAYOUT, COLOUR USAGE AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF READING IS BEGINNING
TO SUPPLY THE TOOLS WHICH HELP TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TEXT IS MORE THAN STRINGS
OF CHARACTERS SUITABLE FOR VISUAL PERCEPTION IN A GIVEN SEQUENCE.
