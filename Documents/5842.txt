PURCHASING KEYS' METHODS OF CARRYING OUT IDEAS ON STOCK-BUILDING.

MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID AT PRESENT TO STOCK-BUILDING PROBLEMS, INCLUDING
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK. WORKING OUT
STOCK-BUILDING PRINCIPLES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND THIS IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF
STOCK-BUILDING, EVEN IF IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. A PURCHASING KEY IS A CODING
SYSTEM FOR THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES; EXPERIENCES IN
MAGDEBURG HAVE PROVED THE KEY TO BE A USEFUL RATIONALISATION METHOD. THROUGH
THE CODING SYMBOLS THE LIBRARIAN CAN SEE QUICKLY WHAT TYPES OF LITERATURE ARE
IN WHICH LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK. THE SYMBOLS ARE FLEXIBLE AND CAN EASILY BE
KEPT UP TO DATE. OTHER STOCK-BUILDING CRITERIA ARE LITERARY MERIT, SPECIALIST
DEMAND, FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK, NUMBERS OF READERS,
SPACE AND MONEY.
