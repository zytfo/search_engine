NORTHERN RHINELAND PALATINATE IN 1979.

THE NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
CENTRE PUBLISHED THE 1979 REPORT CONCERNING EXTERNAL LENDING AND BORROWING
STATISTICS. 175 LIBRARIES IN THE REGION WERE AUTHORISED LENDING LIBRARIES IN
1979. THE UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES TO 273 LIBRARIES,
DEPARTMENTS AND GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. 270 OF THESE WERE COMPLETED AND
RETURNED. THE NUMBER OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS LEVELLED OFF IN COMPARISON TO THE
HIGH 1976 FIGURES AND DROPPED IN SOME CASES. THERE WERE SOME EXCEPTIONS SUCH
AS THE COLOGNE ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN WHICH HAD A GROWTH RATE OF 13%.
THERE WAS A RISE IN BOOKS ORDERED BY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES OF 3.7%. A
CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF BOOKS LENT TO OTHER LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY AND ABROAD WAS EVIDENT. MORE BOOKS WERE BORROWED BY THE REGIONAL
LIBRARIES THAN WERE SUPPLIED BY THEM AND THE FIGURES FOR BOOKS SUPPLIED
DROPPED IN COMPARISON TO EARLIER STATISTICS.
