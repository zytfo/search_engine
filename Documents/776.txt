DEMAND-ADJUSTED SHELF AVAILABILITY PARAMETERS.

A MEASURE OF LIBRARY PERFORMANCE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PATRON CAN FIND
THE MATERIAL SOUGHT. THIS PARAMETER, DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY, IS BEST MEASURED
BY SAMPLING THE EXPRESSED DEMAND. SAMPLING THE SHELF-LIST IS FAR LESS
INTRUSIVE, BUT FAILS TO PROVIDE DATA ON COLLECTION ADEQUACY, USER CATALOGUE
AND SHELF SKILLS, AND FACTORS INHIBITING AVAILABILITY (SUCH AS CIRCULATION).
DESCRIBES A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR ADJUSTING SHELF-LIST DATA TO REFLECT
EXPRESSED DEMAND RESULTS AND PRESENTS A WORKED EXAMPLE, EXPLAINING THE STEPS
INVOLVED.
