EFFECTS OF MAKING LONGER OPEN-HOURS ON THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY USERS.
     
THE SAITAMA MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY EXTENDED ITS HOURS UNTIL 8PM IN NOV 79. THE
EFFECT OF THE EXTENSION WAS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS
ENTERING THE LIBRARY BETWEEN THE PERIODS OF NOV 78 THROUGH APR 79, AND NOV 79
THROUGH APR 80. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENTERING THE LIBRARY
INCREASED FOR EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK EXCEPT FRIDAYS; THE OVERALL PEAK LIBRARY
HOURS INCREASED BY 1 HOUR AND EXTEND BETWEEN 12 NOON TO 5PM, INSTEAD OF THE
PREVIOUS 12 NOON TO 4PM. THE STATUS ANALYSIS OF THE LIBRARY PATRONS SHOWED AN
INCREASE IN EVERY CATEGORY, AND THE PEAK LIBRARY HOURS FOR STUDENTS EXTENDED
BETWEEN 12 NOON AND 5PM, INSTEAD OF THE PREVIOUS 12 NOON TO 3PM. THE PEAK
HOURS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF DID NOT CHANGE.
