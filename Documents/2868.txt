STANDING CONFERENCE ON CENTRAL CATALOGUES.
     
THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE'S COMMITTEE ON CENTRAL CATALOGUES WAS DISBANDED
IN 1980 AND, TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF ITS WORK, A STANDING CONFERENCE ON
CENTRAL CATALOGUES WAS ESTABLISHED, MEETING 3 TIMES A YEAR. WORK CONTINUES ON
TRANSFERRING CENTRAL CATALOGUES TO MICROFICHES, AND THE CATALOGUES OF BAVARIA
AND NORTH-RHINELAND WESTPHALIA ARE BEING ADDED IN 1981. THE STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LOANS HAS BEEN EXAMINED.
