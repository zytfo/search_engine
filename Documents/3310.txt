PLANNING ACQUISITIONING OF A JOINT STOCK IN A CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
PLANNED ACQUISITIONING SHOULD BE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE STOCK'S
COMPOSITION AND AN EVALUATION OF ITS BASIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE USSR CULTURE
MINISTRY RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING SUBJECT RATIOS' SOCIOPOLITICAL LITERATURE
19%-20% OF STOCK; NATURAL SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS AND MEDICINE 6%-7%; TECHNOLOGY
AND AGRICULTURE-EACH 6%; ART AND SPORT-6%-7%; FICTION-48%-50%; LINGUISTICS,
LITERATURE, GEOGRAPHY AND GENERAL-8%. LITERATURE OF THE LAST 5 YEARS SHOULD
COMPRISE 50% OF STOCK. CORRESPONDENCE OF THE STOCK'S SUBJECT CONTENT WITH
READERS' REQUIREMENTS IS REVEALED BY COMPARING ITS SUBJECT STRUCTURE WITH THAT
OF THE ISSUE. LANGUAGE COMPOSITION OF STOCK SHOULD ALSO DEPEND ON READER
DEMAND. RESULTS OF STOCK-EVALUATION MUST UNDERLY THE PLANNING OF CURRENT
ACQUISITIONS AND 5-YEAR PLANS.
