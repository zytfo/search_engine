AUCKLAND PUBLIC'S ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE.

IN JUNE 80, A NEW ZEALAND POST OFFICE OASIS TERMINAL (OVERSEAS ACCESS SERVICE
TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS) STARTED OPERATING IN THE COMMERCE, SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF AUCKLAND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ITS ADVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY ARTICLES IN LOCAL PAPERS, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND BASIC ON-LINE TRAINING
OF LIBRARY STAFF. DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE 1ST 10 MONTHS OF
THE SERVICE AND DISCUSSES CHANGING PHILOSOPHIES WORLDWIDE. CONCLUDES THAT
ON-LINE SEARCHING IS COMING TO BE REGARDED AS AN EXTENSION OF TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE SERVICES; IT WILL NEVER BE SELF-FINANCING AND MUST BE PLANNED,
BUDGETED FOR, INTRODUCED AND DIRECTED LIKE ANY OTHER ASPECT OF LIBRARY WORK;
ITS SPEED HIGHLIGHTS THE PRESENT SLOWNESS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY; AND IT IS A
NEW CHALLENGE TO THE LIBRARIAN'S PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND JUDGEMENT.
