FINAL REPORT.

REPORT OF RESEARCH INITIATED DUE TO THE FACT THAT ONLY 2 OHIO LIBRARY SCHOOLS
ACCREDITED BY THE ALA ARE LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO, MERELY 35 MILES APART.
THE STUDY INCLUDES A NEEDS ASSESSMENT, A RESOURCES ASSESSMENT, AND AN ANALYSIS
OF 4 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES-A NEW PROGRAMME MODEL, A PROGRAMME TRANSFER MODEL,
AN EXTENSION MODEL, AND A CONSORTIUM MODEL. AMONGST THE CONCLUSIONS ARE THE
FOLLOWING' NORTHEASTERN OHIO WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 40% OF THE PROFESSIONAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE THROUGH 1990; A NEW GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL
NOT BE WARRANTED IN THE 1980S BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT JOB MARKET; AND TRANSFER OF
KENT'S PROGRAMME TO COLUMBUS WOULD LEAVE A SERIOUS GAP IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO.
