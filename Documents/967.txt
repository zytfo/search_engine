THE EVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND PUBLISHING IN AMERICA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING REFORM. GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND PUBLISHING STARTED AS A
CONGRESSIONAL FUNCTION AND ONLY GRADUALLY EVOLVED INTO AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH
ACTIVITY. POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING PRINTING ARE STILL MADE BY CONGRESS. THE
EVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING FROM THE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLICATION
FACILITIES, TO FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE),
AND FINALLY TO A COMBINATION OF OFFICIAL AGENCIES AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, HAS
OFTEN BEEN UNEASY.
