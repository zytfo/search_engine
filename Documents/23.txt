FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.
