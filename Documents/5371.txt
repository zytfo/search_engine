A COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.

A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TO
REPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.
IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEM
GENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THAT
ONLY 1 WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITH
FUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHER
PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING IS
THEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2 SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THE
LIMIT OF ZERO/1 WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONAL
BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
