THE PATENT SYSTEM AND THE MEDIUM-SIZED INDUSTRY.

SHORTENED VERSION OF A LECTURE AT THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SMALL AND
MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (ISSB SYMPOSIUM), BERLIN, 30 OCT 79. THE MAJORITY OF
PATENT APPLICATIONS IN WEST GERMANY ARE FILED BY SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED
INDUSTRIES (SMI) OR PRIVATE INVENTORS. MANY SMI, HOWEVER, DO NOT MAKE FULL USE
OF THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY PATENTING AND THEY HAVE ONLY RECENTLY
ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENT LITERATURE AS A SOURCE OF TECHNICAL
INFORMATION. ANALYSES SOME EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS; OUTLINES THE ADVANTAGES OF
PATENT PROTECTION; AND CONCLUDES THAT THE WEST GERMAN PATENT OFFICE SHOULD
MAKE ACCESS TO ITS STOCK OF INFORMATION EASIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE.
