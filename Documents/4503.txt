INDIA'S LIBRARIES ARE WAITING.
     
OUTLINES THE PRESENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN INDIA. ONLY
5 STATES HAVE LIBRARY LAWS, OPERATING WITH INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS. THE
LAWS ARE, HOWEVER, WEAK AND FINANCING OF LIBRARIES INADEQUATE. AT UNION LEVEL,
LIBRARY LEGISLATION WAS THE SUBJECT OF A COMMITTEE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD IN
1964, BUT WITH LACK OF INTEREST AMONG THE AUTHORITIES, NO ACTION HAS BEEN
TAKEN YET. IN THE MEANTIME, LIBRARIES FACE CHALLENGES FROM INCREASING NUMBERS
OF USERS, THE NEWLY LITERATE AND STUDENTS. THERE ARE MANY LIBRARY TYPES; APART
FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN CALCUTTA, THERE ARE STATE CENTRAL, DISTRICT,
BLOCK, VILLAGE, MOBILE, UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES OF
VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARIES ARE NUMEROUS. BUT THE NEED FOR
RESOURCES, AND PERHAPS A SUCCESSOR TO THE DYNAMIC S.R. RANGANATHAN, IS GREAT.
