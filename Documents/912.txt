CBS STEPPING OUT FOR FRENCH TELETEXT.

IMPATIENT WITH THE DELAYS CREATED BY THE ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION'S
SUBCOMMITTEE ON TELETEXT, CBS INC. HAS ENDORSED THE FRENCH-DEVELOPED ANTIOPE
TELETEXT SYSTEM AS A US STANDARD. THE MAIN REASONS WHY IT WAS PREFERRED OVER
COMPETING SYSTEMS (INCLUDING THE UK CEEFAX AND ORACLE) IS ITS CAPACITY FOR
ACCOMMODATING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS A SOFTWARE SYSTEM
WITH ITS DATA STREAM FORMULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE TRANSMISSION MODE.
