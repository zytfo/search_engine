DO STOP THIS DIVISION.
     
COMMENTS WITH REGRET ON THE FACT THAT DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES, WHICH FOR 73
YEARS HAD BEEN PART OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (DANMARKS
BIBLIOTEKSFORENING), FELT IT NECESSARY IN 1978 TO FORM THEIR OWN ASSOCIATION
(DANMARKS FORSKNINGSBIBLIOTEKSFORENINGS) AND THUS CAUSING A SPLIT IN THE
DANISH LIBRARY SYSTEM. DESPITE DF'S CHAIRMAN'S CONCILIATORY REMARKS AT DB'S 75
YEARS' JUBILEE IN 1980 THE NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, DF'S VICE CHAIRMAN, MADE SHARP
ATTACKS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES, DB, THE MINISTER FOR CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND OTHER
POLITICIANS IN HIS REPORT TO DF'S ANNUAL MEETING 1981. HE ALSO ATTACKED THE
NEW LIBRARY BILL, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE EDUCATION AND THE
CULTURAL MINISTRIES. THE BILL PROPOSES 1 OVERALL ADMINISTRATION AND A
DIRECTORATE FOR EACH OF THE SECTORS, PUBLIC AND RESEARCH. ARGUES THAT DF
SHOULD SUPPORT THIS UNIFICATION OF THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. DB SHOULD TAKE THE
INITIATIVE BY ORGANISING A MEETING OF ALL PARTIES TO DISCUSS A LINK BETWEEN
THE 2 ORGAN ISATIONS.
