COMPUTER ASSISTANCE IN INDEXING WITH INDEX.
     
DESCRIBES THE COMPILATION OF INDEXES TO 2 BOOKS USING THE PROGRAM INDEX ON THE
MTS (MICHIGAN TERMINAL SYSTEM) OPERATING THE IBM 378/3033 COMPUTER. DISCUSSES
THE ADVANTAGES OF COMPUTER INDEXING, WHICH INCLUDE' SPEED IN PREPARATION;
ACCURACY IN TRANSCRIPTION; AND EASE OF TRANSMISSION FROM 1 LOCATION TO
ANOTHER. CONCLUDES, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS AN AID RATHER THAN A COMPETITOR TO
INDEXES, SINCE AN INDEXER MUST STILL MAKE DECISIONS AS TO CROSS REFERENCING,
SUBHEADS, AND CATEGORIES.
