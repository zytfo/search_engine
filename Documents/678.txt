THE PRACTICE OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH IN LIBRARIES.

THE APPLICATION OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH METHODS TO LIBRARY-TYPE PROBLEMS HAS A
LONG HISTORY WHICH PREDATES THE FORMATION OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY.
ITS PRACTICE CONTINUES TODAY BUT MUCH OF ITS EMPHASIS HAS SHIFTED FROM CONCERN
WITH THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF A LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY MANAGER TO THE MORE
GENERAL PROBLEMS OF DESIGNING LARGE INFORMATION NETWORKS AND SATISFYING THE
INFORMATION NEEDS OF LARGE CLASSES OF USERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SERVICES.
