READABILITY AND SEMANTIC REDUNDANCY THRESHOLD.

USING A SEMANTIC DEFINITION OF REDUNDANCY (ADAPTED FROM COMMUNICATION THEORY),
RELATES THE READABILITY THRESHOLD TO A REDUNDANCY THRESHOLD AND DEFINES
READABILITY THROUGH REDUNDANT SEMANTIC FEATURES, THE EXTENT OF THEIR
INTERSECTION, AND THE CRITICAL INTERVAL BETWEEN RECURRENCES. READABILITY THUS
CONSISTS OF A BALANCE BETWEEN A SUPERSATURATION OF INTERCONNECTED ITEMS AND A
SUBSATURATION OF COMPATIBLE ITEMS WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A PROPORTION.
