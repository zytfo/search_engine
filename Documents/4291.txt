A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELEVANCE JUDGEMENTS BY USERS AND NON-USERS OF A
SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION SERVICE.
     
EXTRACT FROM A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION IN INFORMATION SCIENCE, DESCRIBING AN
INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT IN THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION
DIVISION AT THE SAO PAULO INSTITUTE OF ATOMIC ENERGY, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE
OVER IN 1974 FROM A MANUAL TO AN AUTOMATED SERVICE. A SUMMARY OF THE
PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE RELATING TO RELEVANCE THEORIES, PREVIOUS
STUDIES, AND METHODOLOGY, IS PRESENTED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY,
BASED ON DOCUMENT TITLES, DEVELOPED FOR THIS STUDY TO RATE JUDGEMENTS AND
COLLECT DATA. RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN FULL AND ANALYSED; THE CALCULATION
PROCEDURES ARE EXPLAINED AND DEMONSTRATED. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT USER AND
NON-USER JUDGEMENTS WERE LARGELY SIMILAR; DISAGREEMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE USER AND OBJECTIVE NON-USER EVALUATION
CRITERIA. FINALLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TITLES IN DETERMINING REL EVANCE WAS
CONSIDERED, AND THE CONCLUSION DRAWN THAT FREQUENCY OF PROFILE DESCRIPTORS IN
DOCUMENT TITLES DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE RELEVANT FROM NON-RELEVANT DOCUMENTS.
