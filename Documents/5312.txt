EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY.

CAMBRIDGESHIRE PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HUNGTINGDON DIVISION, HAVE DESIGNED A NEW
LABELLING SYSTEM FOR THE CATEGORISATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. THE SYSTEM WAS
DESIGNED TO HAVE MEANING TO BOTH THE STAFF AND PUBLIC, AND COPYRIGHT FREE
DESIGNS WERE SOUGHT. EACH SIGN IS REPRINTED HERE. THEY INCLUDE A STAR-SHAPED
BADGE FOR WESTERNS, A FLOWER FOR GARDENING AND PLANTS, A TANK FOR WAR, AND A
CLOWN'S FACE FOR 'FUNNY STORIES'. THERE ARE 2 CATEGORIES OF SYMBOLS-1 FOR
ADULTS AND 1 FOR CHILDREN.
