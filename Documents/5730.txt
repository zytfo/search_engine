THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION AND ASSOCIATION CREDIBILITY.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. NLA WAS
FOUNDED IN 1975 TO MEET A LONG-FELT NEED IN MANY LIBRARIANS FOR A NATIONAL
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WHICH WOULD CONCERN ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH LIBRARIAN
ISSUES RATHER THAN WITH THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF ISSUES RELATED TO LIBRARIES IN
SOCIETY. NLA IS SMALL, NEW AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE USA HAS 100,000
LIBRARIANS, BUT NLA HAS ONLY 500 MEMBERS. NO LIBRARY PUBLICATION HAS REPORTED
ON OR EVALUATED NLA'S POSITION PAPERS ON A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF CERTIFICATION
FOR LIBRARIANS AND ON PROFESSIONAL WELFARE. LIBRARY SCHOOLS TEND TO IGNORE
NLA'S OFFERS TO PROVIDE SPEAKERS OR INFORMATION MATERIALS. IN MANY WAYS NLA
HAS ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT STANDS AT A CRITICAL POINT IN ITS
DEVELOPMENT. IT MAY BE THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSING 'BREAD AND BUTTER' ISSUES WILL
PROVIDE THE IMPETUS NLA NEEDS TO REGAIN ITS MOVEMENT TOWARD BECOMING A MAJOR
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARIA NS.
