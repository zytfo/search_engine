BOOK SELECTION PRESSURE ON SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS AND TEACHERS.

REPORT ON A STUDY CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF WARNING SYMBOLS USED
IN CONNECTION WITH BOOK REVIEWS ON THE SELECTION PROCESS. ONE FINDING
INDICATES THAT A BOOK REVIEW WARNING SYMBOL SYSTEM EXERTS A NEGATIVE
CHOICE-AVOIDANCE INFLUENCE UPON ADULT BOOK SELECTORS WHEN CHOOSING CHILDREN'S
BOOKS. RESULTS REINFORCE THE NEED OF BOOK SELECTORS TO READ MORE THAN ONE
SELECTION AID WHEN CHOOSING BOOKS.
