STANDARDISATION OF INFORMATION WORK AS A MEANS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE
ORGANISATION AND METHODOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
DEPARTMENTS.

1 OF THE TRENDS OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE USSR STATE SYSTEM OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION IS STANDARDISATION OF INFORMATION WORK
AND LIBRARY TASKS. APPROXIMATELY 50 STANDARDS ARE PLANNED TO BE PUBLISHED
WITHIN THE 11TH 5-YEAR PLAN. STANDARDS ARE BEING PREPARED BY A NUMBER OF
INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS ATTACHED TO ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND MANUFACTURING
COMPANIES, THUS THE PREPARATION OF STANDARDS IS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENTLY
COORDINATED. AN ANALYSIS OF THE STANDARDISATION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
INFORMATION WORK WAS THEREFORE CARRIED OUT. ITS RESULTS SHOW THAT IT IS
ESSENTIAL TO PREPARE AN UNIFIED PLAN OF STANDARDISATION COVERING ALL ASPECTS
OF INFORMATION WORK. METHODOLOGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS MUST BE PREPARED IN
COOPERATION WITH OFFICIAL BODIES OF THE STATE SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND PARTICULAR ATTENTION SH OULD BE PAID TO THE
TERMINOLOGY USED.
