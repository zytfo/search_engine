A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AND THEIR OPINIONS RELATED TO NINE-MONTH
CONTRACTS AND ACADEMIC STATUS CONFIGURATIONS IN ALABAMA, GEORGIA, AND
MISSISSIPPI.
     
REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF 267 ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS CONDUCTED IN
ALABAMA, GEORGIA, AND MISSISSIPPI. DEMOGRAPHIC AND INSTITUTIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS AND OPINIONS OF LIBRARIANS WITH AND WITHOUT FACULTY STATUS
WERE STUDIED. PUBLICATION, RESEARCH, AND PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND
THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROMOTION OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WAS EXAMINED.
OPINIONS ON NINE-MONTH CONTRACTS, FACULTY STATUS, AND A COMPARABLE SYSTEM THAT
RECOGNISES THE UNIQUE NATURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES OF LIBRARIANS WERE SOUGHT.
THE MAJORITY OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH FACULTY STATUS,
AGREED WITH THE STATEMENT THAT A COMPARABLE SYSTEM WOULD BE A PREFERABLE MODE
OF ADVANCEMENT.
