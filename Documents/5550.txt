THE TEACHING PAMPHLETS PRODUCED BY THE STAFF OF THE INSTITUTE OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY, BERLIN.

THE PAMPHLET SERIES DEVELOPED SINCE 1970, ORIGINALLY FOR USE IN CORRESPONDENCE
COURSES ON BASIC AND POST-GRADUATE LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT IS NOW USED ALSO IN
CLASSES AT THE LIBRARY SCHOOL. THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY COMBINES A BASIC
TRAINING FOR BOTH LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS WITH ADDITIONAL SPECIALIST
OPTIONS; THE STRUCTURE OF THE BASIC LIBRARY SCHOOL AND CORRESPONDENCE COURSES
IS IDENTICAL. THE PAMPHLETS PROVIDE AN INTRODUCTION FOR THE STUDENT TO WORK
WITH READERS, INFORMATION WORK, LIBRARY STOCKS, CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY,
DOCUMENTATION AND STORAGE AND POLITICAL STUDIES. THE SERIES WILL EXPAND TO
INCLUDE MORE DETAILED MONOGRAPHS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, AS HAS
ALREADY HAPPENED WITH A SIMILAR SERIES PRODUCED IN THE USSR.
