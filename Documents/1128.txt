VIDEO AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES: SOME NOTES AND A PROPOSAL.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN CONTEXTS IN WHICH VIDEO MAY BE USED WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICE-AS A STAFF TRAINING TECHNIQUE, AS A RESOURCE OFFERED WITHIN A
LIBRARY-BASED, COMMUNITY ACCESS MEDIA RESOURCE CENTRE, AND AS A REFERENCE
MATERIAL. DESCRIBES EACH CONTEXT BRIEFLY. SUGGESTS THE FORMATION OF A WORKING
PARTY WITHIN THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO EXAMINE SERIOUSLY THE POSSIBILITIES
AND RAMIFICATIONS OF VIDEO.
