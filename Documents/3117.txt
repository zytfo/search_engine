ELECTRON LATTICE SCATTERING TECHNIQUE FOR CITATION ANALYSIS AND EVALUATING THE
IMPACT OF RESEARCH PAPERS.
     
INTRODUCES A PHYSICAL MODEL FOR MEASURING THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION
BASED ON SCATTERING OF ELECTRONS BY THE LATTICE ATOMS. DESCRIBES SCATTERING AS
A STOCHASTIC PROCESS AND ADOPTS AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION IN WHICH LATTICE ATOMS
AND ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A SYSTEM OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND POTENTIAL
CITERS RESPECTIVELY. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABOVE MODEL, THE AUTHORS HAVE
MADE A NUMBER OF SIMPLIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND DEVELOPED AN ABSORPTION
INDEX ACTIVITY TO BE USED AS AN INDEX FOR MEASURING RELATIVE IMPACT OF VARIOUS
CONTRIBUTIONS IN A GIVEN FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
