EXPERIENCES AT THE CONTROL CENTRE OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON AGRICULTURE AND
FOOD IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

2 TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION AND THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN
INFORMATION WORK ARE DESCRIBED WHICH HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES HELPFUL IN THE
CREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE SUBJECT AREAS OF
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FOOD ECONOMICS AND THEIR USE IS ILLUSTRATED WITH
REFERENCE TO INFORMATION ON MILK MARKETING AND GENERAL COOPERATION WITHIN THE
SYSTEM ON THE ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD. IT IS CLEAR THAT, THROUGH
UNIFIED AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL COMPETENCE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE INFORMATION
SERVICES INVOLVED, THROUGH WORK SHARING, SPECIALISATION AND COOPERATION, AN
IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE, QUALITY AND RELATED EFFECTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN
THE PRESENTATION AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION.
