THE GENERATION OF INTEGRATED PUBLIC TRANSPORT TRAVEL INFORMATION BY COMPUTER.

THE EXISTING PROCEDURES UTILISED BY TRAVEL ENQUIRY CLERKS, WHEN ANSWERING
INQUIRIES ON JOURNEYS INVOLVING INTERCHANGE, ARE OFTEN CUMBERSOME AND
SOMETIMES SLOW. THE USE OF A COMPUTER TO COMPILE TRAVEL INFORMATION WOULD THUS
APPEAR TO BE OF BENEFIT TO TRAVELLERS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS ALIKE BY
PROVIDING THE FACILITIES FOR QUICKER, MORE ACCURATE AND CONSISTENT RESPONSES
TO INQUIRERS. THE PRACTICABILITY OF PRODUCING COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT WOULD
GENERATE SCHEDULES OF TRIP-OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT TIMETABLES
WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE TRANSPORT AND ROAD RESEARCH LABORATORY. (SEE ALSO
