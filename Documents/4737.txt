EFFICIENCY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WORK IN DISTRICT LIBRARIES.
     
THE STARTING POINT FOR THE FORMULATION OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM MODEL IS THE

AND STIMULATE THEM IN AGREEMENT WITH BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY'S NEEDS. VERY
IMPORTANT IS THE COOPERATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SERVICES WHICH SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO A WIDER BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM. A STUDY
OF THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISTRICT LIBRARIES SHOWED, HOWEVER, SOME
SHORTCOMINGS.
