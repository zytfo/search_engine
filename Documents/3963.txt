COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN SEARCHING FOR METALLURGICAL INFORMATION.
     
A COMPARISON HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DATA BASES IN SEARCHING FOR
METALLURGICAL INFORMATION IN 4 SYSTEMS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE'
ESA-QUEST, LOCKHEED-DIALOG, INKA-GRIPS AND THERMODATA. A FEW DIFFERENT SEARCH
PROFILES WERE PREPARED IN ORDER TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE DIFFERENT
SYSTEMS. THE ANALYSIS OF SEARCH COSTS WAS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY. AN OUTLINE
WAS GIVEN OF FACILITIES FOR GETTING THE DOCUMENTS. THE USEFULNESS OF THE
INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS CHECKED BY INTERVIEWING THE
CUSTOMERS. THE UTILITY OF THE NEW FACTUAL DATA BANK INCLUDED IN THE THERMODATA
SYSTEM WAS EMPHASISED.
