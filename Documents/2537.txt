THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN.
     
THE CAREER OF A LIBRARIAN SHOULD COMBINE THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF LIBRARIANSHIP
WITH ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH. NOWADAYS NEW RESEARCH IN LIBRARY SCIENCE
IS USUALLY CARRIED OUT IN TEAMS RATHER THAN BY INDIVIDUALS. MODERN LIBRARIANS
HAVE TO POSSESS A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE COVERING MANY FIELDS AND IT IS NO
LONGER USUAL FOR A LIBRARIAN TO BE AN EXPERT IN ONLY 1 SUBJECT. TEACHERS AT
LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN PART-TIME LIBRARIANS AND PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF DAILY LIBRARY ACTIVITY, WHICH PREVENTS COURSES FROM BECOMING
MERELY THEORETICAL. THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IS REFLECTED
IN THE SYLLABUSES OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH DEVOTE MORE TIME TO CURRENT LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECTS THAN BEFORE.
