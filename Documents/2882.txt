MODELLING AND EVALUATING EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH
COMBINED RETRIEVAL SCHEME.
     
DISCUSSES A MODEL OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE USE OF A
RETRIEVAL SCHEME WHICH COMBINES DIRECT AND INVERSE RETRIEVAL PRINCIPLES.
DESCRIBES HOW THE INFORMATION PROCESS IS SIMULATED AND EVALUATED IN THE MODEL.
PRESENTS AND ANALYSES SOME EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.
