CHANGES DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS (1969-1978) IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY DECISION
PROCESS FOR THE PLACEMENT AND RENEWAL OF SCHOLARLY PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND
NETWORKS TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES ON THEM. THE LIBRARIES MUST FACE THEIR
PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL
ACADEMIC LIBRARY COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES MOVE FORWARD MORE RAPIDLY AND
PURPOSEFULLY.
