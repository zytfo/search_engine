THE CONCEPTION OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INFORMATION FROM THE POINT
OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION OF SYMBOLS.
     
USING THE UNIVERSAL MODEL OF TRANSFORMATION OF INFORMATION AND THROUGH
STRUCTURE OF DATA FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION, THE
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY
INFORMATION ARE OUTLINED. ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE SYMBOL IS A REFLECTION OF
PHENOMENA OR A REFLECTION OF A SYMBOL (SIGN), VARIOUS ORDERS OF THE REFLECTION
ARE RECOGNISED, I.E. THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOL REFLECTION. THUS PRIMARY
INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF A PHENOMENON DEPOSITED WITHOUT A SIGN/MARK,
SECONDARY INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE DEPOSITED SIGNS, ETC. THE
STATEMENT GIVING THE SPACE AND TIME IN WHICH A PHENOMENON IS VALID IS CALLED
THE ADDRESS.
