COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR ANALYSIS OF BIBLIOMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS.

(MSC DISSERTATION-CITY UNIVERSITY, LONDON). A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS IS
GIVEN FOR THE ANALYSIS OF AUTHOR AND JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA. THE PROGRAMS
WERE WRITTEN USING SUBPROGRAMS FROM THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND USING THE FORTRAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THE
AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS 1ST PROCESS RAW AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY DATA
(CONSISTING OF AUTHOR CODES AND ARTICLE NUMBERS). THEN THE WEIBULL, NEGATIVE
BINOMIAL AND 2 FORMS OF THE LOTKA DISTRIBUTION ARE COMPARED WITH THE OBSERVED
DISTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY, USING THE CHI SQUARED AND
KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS. THE JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS
ALLOW RAW JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA (CONSISTING OF JOURNAL CODES AND ARTICLE
NUMBERS) TO BE PROCESSED. THE PROCESSED DATA IS USED TO PLOT BRADFORD, YIELD
FORMULA AND NARANAN GRAPHS BY COMPUTER. REASONS FOR CHOOSING THESE AUTHOR AND
JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE G IVEN, AND APPLICATIONS OF THE
PROGRAMS IN OTHER AREAS OF BIBLIOMETRICS ARE EXAMINED. FINALLY, USEFUL
DEVELOPMENTS TO THE SUITE OF PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED.
