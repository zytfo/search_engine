STOIC INFLUENCES IN LIBRARIANSHIP: A CRITIQUE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. EXPRESSES A DEEP INDEBTEDNESS BY LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS TO THE THOUGHT AND CULTURE OF ANCIENT GREECE, BUT
SOUNDS A WARNING TO INFORMATION SCIENTISTS THAT SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED
FROM THE GREEKS ARE BEING BLINDLY AND UNTHINKINGLY MISAPPLIED TODAY, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF CLEAR THINKING ABOUT LIBRARY PROBLEMS. DESCRIBES THE ANCIENT
GREEK THEORY OF THE SIGN EXPRESSING THE RELATION BETWEEN WORDS, THOUGHTS, AND
THINGS WHICH IS STILL INFLUENTIAL IN PHILOSOPHY, LINGUISTICS, AND PSYCHOLOGY,
BUT IS OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY INVOKED IN THESE DISCIPLINES AND IN LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND THE STUDY OF COMMUNICATION. THE MODEL IS AMBIGUOUS,
AND SO AN ALTERNATIVE, BASED ON HUMAN LINGUISTICS, IS PROPOSED.
