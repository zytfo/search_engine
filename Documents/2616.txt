A VISIT TO BRENT PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
A GERMAN LIBRARIAN RECORDS HER IMPRESSIONS OF THIS LONDON BOROUGH'S LIBRARY
WORK WITH FOREIGN MINORITY GROUPS, INCLUDING WEST INDIANS, AFRICANS, INDIANS
AND PEOPLE OF MIXED RACE. SINCE 5 DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN IN
BRENT, ALL LIBRARY NOTICES ARE PUBLISHED IN THEM AS WELL AS IN ENGLISH. THE
TRADITIONAL FORM OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, COMPRISING A CENTRAL LIBRARY WITH
BRANCHES CLOSELY DEPENDENT UPON IT, SEEMED NO LONGER SUITABLE FOR THIS
COMMUNITY. A LARGE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY WAS THEREFORE GIVEN TO EACH BRANCH
LIBRARY, HELPING IT TO CATER BETTER FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF ITS DISTRICT.
BOOKS ARE LENT TO YOUTH AND SPORTS CLUBS AND ACTIVITIES ORGANISED FOR
DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS. INTENSIVE TRAINING IS PROVIDED FOR LIBRARY STAFF ON
THE HISTORY, CULTURE AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF THE AFRICAN, ASIAN AND
CARIBBEAN RACES.
