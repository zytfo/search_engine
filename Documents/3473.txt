DISPLAY SYSTEMS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
DESCRIBES 2 RESEARCH PROJECTS BASED IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY AT
QUEEN MARY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. ONE PROJECT, ALREADY COMPLETED, HAS
PRODUCED A NEW PIECE OF HARDWARE-THE 'Q.M.C. TEXT TERMINAL'-WHICH IS A DISPLAY
SYSTEM INCORPORATING 2 PROCESSORS WHICH ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO PROVIDING A
HIGHLY USER-ORIENTED DISPLAY OF TEXTUAL INFORMATION. THE OTHER PROJECT, STILL
IN PROGRESS, AIMS TO DEVELOP A RADICALLY NEW DISPLAY PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY, THE
HOPE BEING THAT IT WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE SPEED OF IMAGE GENERATION
IN BITMAP DISPLAY SYSTEMS.
