HOW TO ARREST IT. BOOKSHOPS SHOULD INSTALL COMPUTER TERMINALS FROM WHICH
CUSTOMERS, FOR PAYMENT, COULD FIND THE INFORMATION WHICH WILL ANSWER THEIR
QUERIES. BOOKSELLERS MUST REALISE THAT THEY ARE INFORMATION PROVIDERS AND
SHOULD BE WILLING TO HANDLE THE INFORMATION SERVICES NOW BEING PUBLISHED BY
MANY SECTIONS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AND ALSO OTHER PUBLICATIONS NOW NOT
NORMALLY FOUND IN BOOKSHOPS. DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC BOOK, OR
'POCKET READER'. THIS MEDIUM WILL BE ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR SMALL EDITION

SUPERMARKETS. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD SECURE THIS TRADE, OTHERWISE RADIO DEALERS
AND RECORD SHOPS WILL CAPTURE IT.
