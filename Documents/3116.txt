COHERENT INFORMATIONAL ENERGY AND ENTROPY.
     
AIMING TO PROVIDE A COMMON THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR ALL KNOWN BIBLIOMETRIC
LAWS, STARTS FROM A SYSTEMIC VIEW OF THE INFORMATION TRANSFER PROCESS AND
LIKENS IT TO A PHYSICAL DIFFUSION PROCESS, IN PARTICULAR THE CONDUCTION OF
HEAT IN SOLIDS. THE INTEREST POTENTIAL OF NEW AUTHORS IS EQUIVALENT TO
TEMPERATURE. THE MODEL ALSO ALLOWS FOR NEW DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATIONAL ENERGY
AND ENTROPY, CORRESPONDING TO THE PHYSICAL DEFINITIONS. DISCUSSES THE
POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING INFORMATION INTO CONCRETE THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEMS
ANALYSIS.
