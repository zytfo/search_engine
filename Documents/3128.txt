A COMPARISON OF MEDIA SERVICES OF WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OREGON
STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.
     
THE EDUCATIONAL MEDIA PROGRAMMES, STAFFING, AND BUDGETS OF 27 COMMUNITY
COLLEGES IN WASHINGTON AND 7 STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OREGON ARE
COMPARED IN THIS STUDY. THE RESULTS INDICATE CLOSE SIMILARITY IN THE TYPES OF
SERVICES OFFERED. MOST WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE INTEGRATED
LIBRARY-MEDIA PROGRAMMES. LESS THAN HALF OF THE STATE COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES IN OREGON HAVE INTEGRATED LIBRARY-MEDIA PROGRAMMES. MEDIA STAFF
SIZE APPEARS TO BE LARGER IN OREGON WITH RESPECT TO THE RATIO OF STAFF TO
STUDENTS BUT SMALLER IN TERMS OF THE RATIO OF STAFF TO FACULTY. ALTHOUGH THE
OVERALL MEDIA DOLLARS SPENT PER STUDENT ARE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2
STATES, THE WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A MORE GENEROUS BUDGET FOR
OPERATIONS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS.
