INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF LIBRARIES.
     
IN NOV 81, THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STANDARDISATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AND EQUIPMENT OF LIBRARIES WAS HELD IN PRAGUE. ADAPTATION OF BUILDINGS FOR
LIBRARY SERVICES AS WELL AS WORKING TECHNIQUES IN LIBRARIES WERE ALSO ON THE
AGENDA. 57 PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONFERENCE CAME FROM 8 SOCIALIST COUNTRIES,
INCLUDING CUBA AND VIETNAM. LECTURES AND DISCUSSIONS WERE COMPLEMENTED BY
VISITS TO THE CZECH STATE LIBRARY AND TO THE PATENTS LIBRARY. THE PURPOSE OF
THE CONFERENCE WAS NOT ONLY TO DISCUSS THE LATEST INFORMATION BUT ALSO TO
OUTLINE PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE, AND TO ENCOURAGE CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN
THE COMECON COUNTRIES. IT WAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT EXPANSION OF LIBRARIES
MUST NOT BE HAMPERED BY THE INEVITABLE ECONOMIC CRITERIA. THE TECHNICAL CENTRE
FOR CZECHOSLOVAK LIBRARIES IN PRAGUE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST, AND IT
WAS SUGGESTED THAT SIMILAR ESTABLISHMENTS BE SET UP IN ALL SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES.
