AFTER FIVE YEARS' AN ASSESSMENT OF THE AMENDED U.S. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.

INFORMATION AGENCIES WOULD LIKE TO WITHHOLD AND WITHOLDS SOME INFORMATION THAT
REQUESTERS WOULD LIKE RELEASED. OVERALL, IT PROBABLY STRIKES A BALANCE. A
CONTINUING CHALLENGE IN THE 1980S IS THE STATEMENT OF RECORDS BY ARCHIVISTS SO
THAT EVERYONE-AGENCIES, RESEARCHERS, LAWYERS, AND EVEN JUDGES-WILL UNDERSTAND
IT.
