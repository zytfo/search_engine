A FORMAL TREATMENT OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
DEALS WITH A MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE
MODEL OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS IS GIVEN AS AN INTERPRETATION OF A
FORMAL LANGUAGE. IN THE FORMAL LANGUAGE, A CONCEPT OF THE LABELLED TERMS IS
INTRODUCED AS THE MOST BASIC CONCEPT, FROM A VIEWPOINT OF HIERARCHICAL
SEMANTIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTS. THE LABELS ARE INTENDED TO DENOTE
THE CONTEXT INFORMATION, CALLED THE INFORMATION FUNCTIONS IN THIS PAPER, IN
THE TEXT OF DOCUMENTS.
