THE ADVENTURES OF READING AND THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN.
     
A TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH OF A PAPER BY THE DIRECTRIX OF THE
FRENCH JOY THROUGH BOOKS PROGRAMME, FOUNDED IN 1963 TO DEVELOP CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF READING IN RELATION TO THE
PROLIFERATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF BOTH THE
RECREATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL ADVANTAGES OFFERED. IN THE LIBRARY, THE CHILD
IS FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN READING MATERIAL, AND IT IS HERE THAT THE MEDIATION
OF AN ADULT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE YOUNG INITIATE IS ENCOURAGED IN HIS
ENTHUSIASMS, IN LEARNING HOW TO USE AND ENJOY BOOKS, AND IN APPRECIATING THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN READING AND LIFE. WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF THE
LIBRARIAN, THE LIBRARY CAN ONLY BE A DISTRIBUTION CENTRE.
