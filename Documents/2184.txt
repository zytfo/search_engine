SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.
     
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981. THESE
SHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2% REAL
GROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW AN
OVERALL FALL OF 4%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORE
THAN 185 KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THIS
STATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,
ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
PART-TIME LIBRARIES SHOW LARGER PERCENTAGE INCREASES THAN FULL-TIME LIBRARIES.
ONLY THE SOUTHERN JUTLAND REGION SHOW A CONSIDERABLE REAL INCREASE IN
EXPENDITURE ON MATERIALS. AS STAFF SALARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TOPPING UP IF
NECESSARY, THESE DO NOT SUFFER AS MUCH FROM CUTS AS MATERIAL EXPENDITURE, AND
THE PROSPECT IS ONE OF LIBRARIES WITH OUTDATED AND WORN BOOKS.
