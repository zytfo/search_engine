HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY OF GRAZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY 1875-1975.

PART 1 OF AN ARTICLE ON THE HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY AT GRAZ TECHNICAL
UNIVERSITY. THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY WERE LAID IN 1811 WHEN
ARCHDUKE JOHANN REALISED HIS PLANS FOR A SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION AND DONATED
HIS PRIVATE COLLECTION, INCLUDING BOOKS, TO THE PROVINCE OF STEIERMARK, BUT IT
DID NOT BECOME A STATE INSTITUTION UNTIL 1874 AND A LIBRARY, WITH ITS OWN
BUILDING, BUDGET AND STAFF, WAS NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL 1889. THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE ACADEMIC STAFF AND THE LIBRARY WAS ALWAYS FRAUGHT WITH
DIFFICULTIES AND FULL INDEPENDENCE FOR THE LIBRARY WAS NOT ACHIEVED UNTIL
1960. BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES OF THE 8 LIBRARY DIRECTORS TO DATE AND A REVIEW OF
STAFFING AND BUDGETS UP TO 1975 ARE INCLUDED.
