THE CONCEPTION AND BIRTH PANGS OF OCLC-AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUGGLES OF THE
FORMATIVE YEARS.

IN 1951 A SMALL GROUP OF HEAD LIBRARIANS FROM 1 MUNICIPAL AND SEVERAL PRIVATE
COLLEGES GOT TOGETHER TO COOPERATE AMONG THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR RESOURCES
AND SERVICES. THEY WERE SOON JOINED BY OTHERS, INCLUDING THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN
THE LARGEST STATE-ASSISTED AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN OHIO. IT REQUIRED THE
STRENUOUS, OFTEN AGONIZING EFFORTS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AND COLLEGE
PRESIDENTS, WORKING THROUGH THE OHIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE OHIO COLLEGE
ASSOCIATION, TO CONCEIVE AND DELIVER THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC
INC.) IN 1967.
