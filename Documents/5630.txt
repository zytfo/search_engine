IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE NETHERLANDS.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN 250,000 IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR
RELATIVES FROM THE POORER MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES TOGETHER WITH A FURTHER
200,000 FROM THE FORMER DUTCH COLONIES. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BRANCH LIBRARIES
IN AREAS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANT RESIDENTS HAVE PROVIDED MATERIAL IN
THE IMMIGRANTS' NATIVE LANGUAGES. AT NATIONAL LEVEL THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) SET UP A
COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN JAN 78. THE
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE PUBLISHED IN 1979 RECOMMENDED THE NATIONAL
COORDINATION OF THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS FOR IMMIGRANTS AND THE
APPOINTMENT OF A STAFF-MEMBER AT THE NBLC WITH SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS.
