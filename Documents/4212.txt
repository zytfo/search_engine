AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF OPERATIONAL MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEMS, AUTUMN, 1979.
     
TRADITIONALLY COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED, BOTH IN
SCALE AND TYPE, BY THE RELATIVELY HIGH PRICE OF CONVENTIONAL COMPUTER
EQUIPMENT. ADVANCES IN MICROELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY, AND ESPECIALLY
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED MACHINES, SUCH AS MICROCOMPUTERS AND WORD PROCESSORS,
HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR RADICALLY ALTERING THIS SITUATION. REPORTS ON A SURVEY
UNDERTAKEN BY ASLIB TO SEE HOW FAR THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS PENETRATED THE LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION WORLD. SYSTEMS IN THE VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS VISITED ARE
DESCRIBED, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE UTILISED.
