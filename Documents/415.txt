BROWSING IN DATA BASES.

CONSIDERS THE TASKS OF TRYING TO FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CAUSES OF THE
CRASHES OF SEVERAL AIRCRAFT OF A COMMON TYPE, THE CAUSES OR EARLY WARNING
SIGNS FOR VARIOUS DISEASES, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STOCKS WITH HIGH GROWTH
POTENTIAL OR ADVANCED WARNINGS OF SEVERAL WEATHER CONDITIONS. ALL OF THESE
TASKS REQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA AND VALUABLE TIME SPENT SIFTING THROUGH
THE DATA. A BROWSING COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD ALSO PERFORM THESE TASKS. THIS
THESIS EXAMINES ONE POSSIBLE ORGANISATION FOR A BROWSING SYSTEM CONTAINING
MODELS AND HEURISTICS. THE MODELS DESCRIBE THE ORGANISATION OF THE DATA BASE
AND THE OBJECTS FROM WHICH THE DATA WAS GATHERED.
