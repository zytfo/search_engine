OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK.
     
LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965 WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATED
BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDE
USE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLE
INFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGE
BASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS IN
SCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES',
HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISH
SYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN
1967. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND
DECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60, 000 TITLES
ANNUALLY FROM 4,000 TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, AND
HOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAIN
PRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISH
LIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.
