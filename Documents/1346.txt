TAMING THE SERIALS BUDGET.

SUGGESTS THAT UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES CAN PUT THEIR UNMANAGEABLY
OVERWEIGHT SERIALS BUDGET ON A SENSIBLE DIET BY LIMITING NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS;
ANALYSING THE SERIALS COLLECTION; PERHAPS DEVELOPING A SERIALS COLLECTION
BASED ON THE BOOK COLLECTION PROFILE; AND THEN DEVELOPING A SENSIBLE SERIALS
COLLECTION POLICY WITH THE LONG-TERM FUTURE IN MIND.
