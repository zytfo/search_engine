ON-LINE, NEW AID IN REFERENCE WORK, 2' COMPUTER SEARCHES FOR THE BUSINESS
WORLD.
     
EXAMINES ON-LINE SYSTEMS IN ENGLISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF VISITS IN
CONNECTION WITH A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HELD
IN SEPT 81. LUTON CENTRAL LIBRARY HAS FOUND THAT AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE
SEARCH METHODS HAS INCREASED USE OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICE BY BUSINESSMEN AND
HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF IN PARTICULAR. HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY LIBRARY INSTALLED A
TERMINAL IN 1975 AND CARRIED OUT ON-LINE SEARCHES; AS A RESULT IT WAS ABLE TO
CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SOME REFERENCE WORKS. IN 1981 IT ACQUIRED AN SCL
MICROCOMPUTER FOR ACCESSION AND ISSUE CONTROL. BIRMINGHAM CENTRAL LIBRARY HAS
A TERMINAL IN THE TECHNICAL REFERENCE ROOM, WITH ACCESS BY ALL DEPARTMENTS,
BUT NOT THE PUBLIC. IT REGARDS THE ON-LINE SERVICE ONLY AS AN ADDITIONAL
REFERENCE TOOL. NONE OF THE LIBRARIES UNDERTOOK COMPUTER SEARCHES OF THEIR OWN
STOCK, BUT ONLY IN INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT SEARCH
EFFIC IENCY INCREASED IF USERS WERE INTERVIEWED FIRST, BUT NOT PRESENT DURING
THE ACTUAL SEARCH, AND THAT THOSE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH SHOULD BE
EXPERIENCED REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR BASE. RAISES THE
QUESTION OF THE EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF REFERENCE WORKS IN PAPER EDITIONS OF
THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES. (FOR PART 1 2SEE BIBLIOTEK 70 1(17)
