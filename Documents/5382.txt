A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 1. DESIGN.

ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,
BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THE
CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,
AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA
BASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESE
REQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FOR
WHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BE
TRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THE
USERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE
'VIRTUAL' SYSTEM TO THE USER. THE INTERFACE ALSO PROVIDES INSTRUCTION AND
OTHER SEARCH AIDS FOR THE USER. PHILOSOPHY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN
EXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE NAMED CONIT ARE DESCRIBED.
