THE CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS.

IN RECENT YEARS TRAINING FOR THE HIGHER STAFF GRADES HAS UNDERGONE A
FUNDAMENTAL REFORM. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES WORKING IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES HAS NOW INCREASED. FORMERLY, ALTHOUGH ALL STAFF IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES POSSESSED UNIVERSITY DEGREES, FEW OF THEM POSSESSED QUALIFICATIONS
IN LIBRARIANSHIP. IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY CONTRAST, MOST SENIOR STAFF HAVE
LIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS. THE NEW SITUATION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY LEGAL
CHANGES, THE FINAL RESULTS OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AT
PRESENT THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF COURSES AVAILABLE; THE BEST BALANCE OF
THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TRAINING MUST BE CHOSEN. FURTHER CONSIDERATION MUST
BE GIVEN TO THE JOINT TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND TO THE
SALARIES OF LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF.
