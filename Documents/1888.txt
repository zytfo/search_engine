INFORMATION PROCESSING TODAY AND TOMORROW.
     
AS A 1ST STEP IN DETERMINING UK LOCAL AUTHORITY INFORMATION-PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT NEEDS, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONAL RESEARCH UNIT COMPILED A
DIRECTORY OF THE MAIN DATA HOLDINGS IN BERKSHIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND
MONITORED ITS USE BY LOCAL OFFICERS. THE DIRECTORY WAS LITTLE-USED; WHEN
OFFICERS REQUIRED DATA, THEY ASKED PERSONAL CONTACTS. THIS INDICATES THAT THE
VALUE OF PROVIDING EXTENSIVE SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL FACILITIES IN LOCAL
AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. THE INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC
RECORD-KEEPING MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO USE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY.
