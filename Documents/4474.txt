SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIAN? LIBRARY SCIENTIST? SCIENTIFICALLY TRAINED LIBRARIAN? OR
DEVELOPING TRAINING DEMANDS OF A DEVELOPING PROFESSION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LASZLO MATRAI HAS
SUGGESTED THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
SCIENTIST OF THE SUBJECT FIELD CARED FOR AND SERVED BY HIM, BUT BY NO MEANS A
LIBRARY SCIENTIST. THUS LIBRARY SKILLS SHOULD BE ATTAINED BY PRACTICE. THE
AUTHOR FEELS THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION IN A LIBRARY IS A COMPLEX
OPERATION, REQUIRING TRAINING AT A HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. THIS TRAINING,
INCORPORATING UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, IS THE ESSENCE OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION
AND IS ESSENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS.
