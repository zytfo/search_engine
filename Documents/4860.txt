THE LATIN MANUSCRIPT FRAGMENTS IN THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY.
     
A COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPT FRAGMENTS HAS BEEN HOUSED IN THE BAVARIAN STATE
LIBRARY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 19TH CENTURY. IN THE 1860S AN INDEX WAS
MADE BY FRIEDRICH KEIN, USING A SCIENTIFIC ARRANGEMENT CLEARLY SEPARATING THE
CLASSICAL FROM THE MEDIAEVAL. IN 1977 A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF THE LATIN
FRAGMENTS WAS CREATED TO ALLOW MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF EACH DOCUMENT AND AN
INDEX COMPILED WHICH AT PRESENT CONTAINS 2,810 ITEMS. THE RANGE OF SIGNATURE
NUMBERS WAS EXTENDED, A CONCORDANCE BEING PROVIDED TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERY
OF TEXTS CITED UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM. INDEXES OF AUTHORS, ANONYMA, PLACES OF
ORIGIN, SIGNATURES, MINIATURES AND INITIALS ARE INCLUDED. THE INDEX MAY BE
MADE INTO A PRINTED CATALOGUE.
