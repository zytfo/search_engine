PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK-TENDENCIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE STANDARD OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK IN WEST GERMANY IS OFTEN
CONSIDERED TO BE LOWER THAN THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. INCREASING FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP
WITH MEDIA INDUSTRY TRENDS MORE DIFFICULT. IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL WISH TO
BE REGARDED AS THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTEMPORARY WORK WITH
CULTURAL MEDIA, THEY MUST PROVIDE BETTER PUBLICITY. EACH LIBRARY HAS
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,
RESULTING IN LESS EXPENDITURE FOR THE LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
'CULTURAL AGENT PROVOCATEUR', ORGANISING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES NOT ONLY TO
INCREASE LOANS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICE QUALITY.
