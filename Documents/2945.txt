PROBLEM OF RETRIEVAL FILE STRUCTURE OPTIMISATION ACCORDING TO RETRIEVAL TIME
CRITERION.
     
WHEN DEVELOPING ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, THE SPEED OF RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES
IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM'S QUALITY. CONSIDERS A
COMPONENT OF RESPONSE TIME-THE DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME. DISCUSSES DIRECT,
INVERSE, AND COMBINED PATTERNS OF FILE ORGANISATION, MAKES A COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS, AND EVALUATES DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME FOR EACH. PROPOSES A
PROBABILITY MODEL OF RETRIEVAL IN A COMBINED FILE. ON THE BASIS OF THIS MODEL,
THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMISING A COMBINED FILE ACCORDING TO THE TIME CRITERION IS
SOLVED.
