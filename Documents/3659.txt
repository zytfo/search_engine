POLITICAL LITERATURE IN LIBRARIES OF THE RUSE REGION.
     
FROM 1974-79, SECTIONS OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN 312 SELECTED PUBLIC, TRADE
UNION AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE RUSE REGION WERE THE SUBJECT OF A
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. 2,018 READERS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 191
WERE INTERVIEWED. THE PROPORTION OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN THE TOTAL BOOK
COLLECTIONS IS ON AVERAGE 20%. THE PEOPLE WHO STUDY POLITICAL LITERATURE ARE
PREDOMINANTLY STUDENTS OR PUPILS. REGRETTABLY, ONLY 31.7% OF THE READERS USED
LIBRARIES AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THEIR NECESSARY LITERATURE. MASS
MEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS PLAY A MUCH GREATER PART IN THIS RESPECT.
THE DESIRABLE TURNOVER OF POLITICAL LITERATURE, THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES,
AND THE DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE BOOKS ARE ALSO COVERED. ON THE WHOLE, THE
LIBRARY SERVICE IS PERFORMING A VALUABLE ROLE IN POLITICAL EDUCATION, BUT EVEN
SO, THERE IS LITTLE ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.
