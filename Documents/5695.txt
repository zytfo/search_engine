ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM
(DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE)' THE CHAIRMAN'S TURN TO SPEAK
(PART) 2.

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. J.J. POSTMA, CHAIRMAN OF THE NBLC ON THE 10TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE. POSTMA BELIEVES THAT LIBRARIANS IN
THE NETHERLANDS SHOULD NOW COME TO TERMS WITH THE NEW PUBLIC SERVICES ACT,
WHICH WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT. BY REFUSING TO ACCEPT
THE ACT LIBRARIANS ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. IN POSTMA'S
VIEW THE DANGER OF THE NEW ACT LIES IN THE DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL
GOVERNMENT. IN SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES, HE ADDS, TOWN FESTIVALS MAY RECEIVE
GREATER PRIORITY THAN THE LIBRARY SERVICE. THE NBLC MUST CONVINCE THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE NEED FOR AN INFORMATION ACT WHICH INCLUDES THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE. (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF PART 1, 2SEE1 82/5007).
