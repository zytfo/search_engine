MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE.
     
ASSOCIATIVE RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES ARE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN A DATA BASE
CONTAINS INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF FULL TEXT AND THE COLLECTION OF TEXTS IS
LARGE AND CHANGING SO FAST THAT NO USER CAN BE FAMILIAR WITH ITS CONTENTS. THE
METER (MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE) SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED
TO APPLY SUCH STRATEGIES EFFECTIVELY AND INEXPENSIVELY FOR A CHANGING DATA
BASE OF UP TO 20,000 MESSAGES (TEXTS OR DOCUMENTS) OF ABOUT 2,000 CHARACTERS
EACH, WITH NEW MESSAGES ARRIVING AT THE RATE OF 4,000-5,000 DAILY. IT RUNS ON
A DEC PDP-11/45 MINICOMPUTER WITHOUT SPECIAL HARDWARE, WITH A RESPONSE TIME OF
ABOUT A MINUTE FOR 5 SIMULTANEOUS USERS, AND WITH NEARLY 24 HOURS/DAY ACCESS.
DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM, ITS BASIC THEORY, AND ITS EVALUATION.
