IS SUCH AN INVESTIGATION WORTHY OF KL?.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
(KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (KL)) ON THE TRIAL RUN OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES'
AUTOMATION SYSTEM, FAUST, IN OLSTYKKE LIBRARY. GIVES THE REASONS FOR THE
FAILURE OF FAUST AS LACK OF PERCEIVED ECONOMIC RETURNS, OPPOSITION OF THE
LIBRARIANS' UNION ON THE GROUNDS OF STAFF REDUCTIONS, AND SIZE OF INITIAL
INVESTMENTS. THE FEW LIBRARIANS WHO POINTED TO IMPROVED SERVICE AND LONG-TERM
ECONOMIC BENEFITS WERE OVERRULED. BIBLIOTEKSDATA, WHICH REPLACED FAUST IN
1978, IS MORE DECENTRALISED, WITH SERVICES TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIES' NEEDS. ARGUES THAT KL IN ITS REPORT DISMISSES THE VALUE OF THE
TRIAL RUN AND THE STAFF'S VIEWS OF THE EXPERIMENT, WHICH STRESS THE
LABOUR-SAVING EFFECTS OF THE AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM. CALLS FOR CENTRAL
REGISTRATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' STOCK IN THE COMMON DATA BASE BY THE LIBRARY
CENTRE; THEN THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY CAN BEGIN REGISTRATION OF ITS OWN STO CK
AND START USING AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL WITH ENSUING IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE
AND LABOUR ECONOMIES.
