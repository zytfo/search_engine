SEMANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.

THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOT
PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHERE
WORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOOD
ELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOW
PRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBY
SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BE
OBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESS
INVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITE
TERMS, PLUS THE USE OF LINK OPERATORS; VARIOUS FORMULATION POSSIBILITIES ARE
ILLUSTRATED. AUTOMATIC INCLUSION OF AUTONOMOUS WORD STRUCTURES IS ALLOWED.
