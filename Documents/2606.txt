ADAPTING AND ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL GOALS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL.
     
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MEDIA CENTRES VARY WIDELY IN SIZE, QUALITY OF SERVICE,
ATMOSPHERE, AND CONTENTS OF COLLECTIONS. THIS DISPARITY IS DUE TO DIFFERENCES
IN BUDGETS, EDUCATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, ARCHITECTURE, CURRICULA,
AND GEOGRAPHY AND POPULATION OF THE SCHOOLS. AUSTINE SCHOOL AFFORDS A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THOSE FACTORS WHICH MAKE ONE SITUATION UNIQUE, BY
REASON OF ITS SPECIALISED NEEDS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES OF SPACE, MONEY,
PERSONNEL AND MATERIALS. ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS IN
SUITING A SCHOOL LIBRARY'S OPERATION TO THE AIMS OF DEAF EDUCATION, TO
ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS IS DONE AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL FOR HEARING HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN, AND TO DRAW GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW A SCHOOL'S LIBRARY CAN BE
SURE OF SATISFYING SPECIALISED NEEDS IN HARMONY WITH ITS ACADEMIC PROGRAMME.
