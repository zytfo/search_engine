BOOKS, LIBRARIES, AND SCHOLARLY TRADITIONS.
     
ADAPTED FROM A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 5TH ANNUAL SPRING CONFERENCE OF THE
LIBRARIANS' ASSOCIATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, CHAPEL HILL, 9
MAR 81. ARGUES THAT LIBRARIANS, SCHOLARS, AND PUBLISHERS MUST WORK MORE
CLOSELY TOGETHER-DESPITE SPECIALISATION, DISTRUST, AND COMPETITION FOR
RESOURCES-DURING A PERIOD OF CHANGE THAT COULD LEAD TO A BOOKLESS WORLD OF
SCHOLARSHIP.
