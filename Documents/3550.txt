CURRENT LIBRARY PROBLEMS IN FINLAND.
     
FINLAND HAS MORE THAN 10 LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS SUOMEN
KIRJASTOSEURA (THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION), ESTABLISHED IN 1910. IT IS
MAINLY CONCERNED WITH FURTHER EDUCATION, PUBLISHING, INFORMATION AND
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. SINCE 1978, THE STATE GRANT TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS
BEEN INCREASED TO 68%, MAKING FINNISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS
OF STATE AID IN SCANDINAVIA. THE 1978 PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER LIBRARY SERVICES
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD TO THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
NOR HAS ANY ACTION BEEN TAKEN ON THE FINANCE MINISTERIAL WORKING PARTY'S
REPORT OF 1979 ON STAFFING AND JOB DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A 3 YEAR
COURSE FOR LIBRARY ASSISTANTS WAS BEGUN IN 1978. THE FINNISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HAS POINTED OUT THAT DESPITE REASONABLE STATE GRANTS, CERTAIN
SECTORS, SUCH AS COUNTY AND MOBILE LIBRARIES, ARE INADEQUATELY FUNDED.
OUTLINES THE ASSOCIATION'S OBJECTIVES FOR THE 1980S.
