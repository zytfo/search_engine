FEATURE COMPARISON OF AN IN-HOUSE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH A
COMMERCIAL SEARCH SERVICE.
     
A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ON-LINE SEARCH SERVICE WAS USED AS A STANDARD FOR
COMPARATIVE SEARCHING AND EVALUATION OF AN IN-HOUSE INFORMATION SYSTEM BASED
ON AUTOMATIC INDEXING. SYSTEM FEATURES WERE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED ON THE
BASIS OF THEIR USEFULNESS IN VARIOUS KINDS OF SEARCHING, THEIR EASE IN
IMPLEMENTATION, AND HOW THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY DIFFERENCES IN USER TYPE OR
SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS. SOME COMMON FEATURES OF THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM, SUCH AS
ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, USER-SPECIFIED PRINT FORMATS, DICTIONARY DISPLAY, AND
TRUNCATION, ARE SEEN TO BE UNNECESSARY OR IMPRACTICAL FOR THE IN-HOUSE SYSTEM.
