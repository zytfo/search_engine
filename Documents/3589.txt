GIVES A PORTRAIT OF SILKEBORG PUBLIC LIBRARY, DENMARK AND COMPARES IT TO THE
LIBRARY OF THE AUTHOR'S CHILDHOOD. INTERVIEWS JUDITTHE BOOCK, THE CHAIRMAN OF
THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE, WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED A CIVIC CENTRE, BUT HAD TO BE
CONTENT WITH A 1,260 SQ.M. EXTENSION IN 1978 AND ACQUISITION OF OTHER
BUILDINGS TO HOUSE THE LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTION AND CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIES, NOW
IN THE MAIN LIBRARY. WOULD LIKE MORE BRANCH LIBRARIES IN THE SUBURBS, BUT
REGARDS MOBILE LIBRARIES AS ADEQUATE FOR THE AUTHORITY'S THINLY POPULATED
PERIPHERY. WELCOMES THE USE OF THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY AS A CHILD MINDING
SERVICE AND LEISURE CENTRE AND APPROVES OF NON-BOOK MATERIAL SUCH AS MUSIC AND
POSTERS. INTERVIEWS THE DRIVER AND MOBILE LIBRARIAN. CHILDREN CONSTITUTE 75%
OF MOBILE LIBRARY USERS, WITH OLD PEOPLE NEXT IN IMPORTANCE. A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP TO THE READERS HAS DEVELOPED AND READERS ARE WELL SATISFIED WITH
THE SELECTION OF BOOKS. INTERVIEWS THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN, POVL SKOV, WHO HOPES
TO OPE N 4 NEW BRANCHES DURING THE 80S. THE CUTS HAVE HITHERTO AFFECTED
PURCHASE OF NEW BOOKS AND STAFFING, BUT SERVICES LIKE RESERVATIONS CAN NO
LONGER BE EXEMPTED. ACCEPTS THAT THE LIBRARY MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME
ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS AS OTHER LOCAL SERVICES.
