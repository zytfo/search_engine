GROUNDS FOR THE AUTOMATION PROPOSAL.
     
THE NORWEGIAN COMPUTER COMMITTEE WILL PRESENT A REPORT ON COMPUTERISATION IN
1982. THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS CONSIDERS THAT A DEFINITE
RULING ON ITS ATTITUDE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED BEFORE THEN.
STRESSING THAT IT DOES NOT OPPOSE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, THAT POTENTIAL USERS
MUST TAKE PART IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS, AND THAT STRICT QUALITATIVE
STANDARDS ARE NECESSARY, IT PRESENTS A 2-PART PROPOSAL RELATING TO TRADE
UNIONS AND LIBRARY POLICY.
