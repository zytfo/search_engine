PRE-AACR2 SPECIAL RECORDS: CORNELL'S EXPERIENCE WITH A CLOSED CATALOG.

PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING FORMS OF ENTRY FOR SERIAL AND MONOGRAPH
TITLES IN AACR2, AND DUE TO THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY INVOLED IN MAINTAINING
AN 8 1/2 MILLION CARD CATALOGUE, THE UNION DICTIONARY CATALOG IN CORNELL
UNIVERSITY'S OLIN RESEARCH LIBRARY WAS CLOSED ON 31 DEC 80. AT THE BEGINNING
OF 1981 A NEW CATALOGUE-THE SUPPLEMENTAL CATALOG-WAS OPENED, AND SUPPLEMENTAL
CATALOGS ALSO REPLACED OTHER CATALOGUES ON THE CORNELL CAMPUS. SERIALS IN THE
SUPPLEMENTAL CATALOGS ARE CATALOGUED ENTIRELY ACCORDING TO AACR2, AND
MONOGRAPHS HAVE AACR2 NAME HEADINGS BUT INCLUDE SOME HYBRID RECORDS WITH
PRE-AACR2 DESCRIPTIVE ELEMENTS. THE CLOSURE AND NEW CATALOGUING ARE DESCRIBED
IN DETAIL.
