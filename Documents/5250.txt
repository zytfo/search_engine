USER AND LIBRARIAN IN CONVERSATION, PT. 2.

WHEN CONTINUING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE OF READERS' ADVISORY WORK CARRIED OUT
BY STAFF IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LIBRARIES, IT WAS NOTED THAT SOME CATALOGUING
MEDIA ARE KEPT FOR STAFF USE ONLY; INSTRUCTION ON THE USE OF OTHERS IS
PROVIDED FOR THE PUBLIC. THE USE OF CATALOGUES AND REFERENCE WORKS FOR SUBJECT
AND TITLE REQUESTS WAS ANALYSED, REVEALING CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS IN THE USE
OF DIFFERENT MEDIA BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THE DICTIONARY CATALOGUE WAS THE
CATALOGUE TYPE MOST WIDELY USED AND SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR SUBJECT AND
KEYWORD REQUESTS ARE DESCRIBED. THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THE NECESSITY OF
EXPANDING LIBRARIANS' SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE AND OF ENCOURAGING FLEXIBLE REACTIONS
BY STAFF TO CONTINUALLY CHANGING SITUATIONS. FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING
ABSTRACT.
