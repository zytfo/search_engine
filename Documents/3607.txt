THE CHRISTELIJK LEKTUUR CENTRUM (CHRISTIAN LITERATURE CENTRE), OR' AN ATTEMPT
AT A CHRISTIAN CONTRIBUTION.
     
THE CHRISTELIJK LEKTUUR CENTRUM WAS FOUNDED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN 1968 AS
SUCCESSOR TO THE BOND VAN CHRISTELIJKE OPENBARE LEESZALEN EN BIBLIOTHEKEN
(ASSOCIATION OF CHRISTIAN PUBLIC READING ROOMS AND LIBRARIES). THE AIM OF THE
CENTRE WAS TO PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF A NETWORK OF PROTESTANT-ORIENTED PUBLIC
LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, AT THE TIME OF THE CENTRE'S
FOUNDATION A NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS HAD PROPOSED THAT A SINGLE NATIONAL
ORGANISATION FREE FROM RELIGIOUS BIAS BE CREATED TO SUPERVISE LIBRARY AFFAIRS
IN THE NETHERLANDS. AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSALS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN
LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WAS FORMED IN
1972. THE CLC WAS ABSORBED INTO THE NEW ORGANISATION AS A SEPARATE SUB-GROUP
AND THROUGH THE NBLC HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROMOTE THE POSITION OF THE PROTESTANT
CHURCH IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS.
