SPACE REQUIREMENTS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
THE COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION PUBLISHED ITS REPORT ON SPACE
REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN MAY 81. THE REPORT DEALS WITH 22
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. IN THE 70S THE TOTAL ANNUAL GROWTH OF SHELF METRES WAS
ABOUT 3%. THE COUNCIL FORECASTS A GROWTH OF ABOUT 4% FOR THE 80S. IT DOES NOT
THINK THAT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROFORMS AND COMPUTERISED SERVICES WILL
CHANGE THE SITUATION IN THE NEXT 15 TO 20 YEARS. SOME OF THE COUNCIL'S
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE' SHELF MEASUREMENT FOR COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE THE
FOLLOWING' OPEN SHELVES 6.3 METRES PER SQ METRE; CLOSED ACCESS 8 SHELF METRES
PER SQ METRE; STORAGE 9.3 METRES PER SQ METRE; AND STACKS 19 METRES PER SQ
METRE. A NATIONAL COOPERATIVE STORAGE LIBRARY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. LIBRARIES
SHOULD HAVE MORE ENCLOSED READING ROOMS AND RESEARCH ROOMS.
