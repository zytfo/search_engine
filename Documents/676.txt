A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES.

A GOAL OF LIBRARIES IS TO ASSURE THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANY USE
STANDARDS AS A METHOD OF ASSURING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES, BUT STANDARDS HAVE
OFTEN FAILED THROUGH A LACK OF INDIVIDUAL COMMITMENT TO THOSE STANDARDS AND TO
THE METHODOLOGY USED IN ESTABLISHING THEM. MANY SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTH CARE
FIELD HAVE ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ARE APPLYING IT TO THE
SERVICE AND CARE THEY PROVIDE. THE PROCESS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE OR
ASSURE QUALITY OF SERVICE. IT INVOLVES' SELECTION OF A SUBJECT FOR REVIEW;
DEVELOPING MEASURABLE CRITERIA; RATIFYING THE CRITERIA; EVALUATING EXISTING
SERVICES USING THE CRITERIA; IDENTIFYING AND ANALYSING PROBLEMS; DEVELOPING
AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS; AND REEVALUATING SERVICES. 2 PILOT QUALITY
ASSURANCE STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE MIDWEST HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARY NETWORK IN
JUNE 78 ARE DESCRIBED. PLANS ARE UNDERWAY TO USE THIS PROCESS ON A REGIONAL
BASIS.
