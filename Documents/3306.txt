SELF-MADE IS WELL MADE' ON-LINE CATALOGUE ACCESS IN THE NORTHWESTERN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE US NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, WHICH USES
THE UNIVERSITY'S CENTRAL COMPUTER. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE NORTHWESTERN ON-LINE
TOTALLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM, (NOTIS), WAS BEGUN WITH THE LIBRARY'S MOVE TO A NEW
BUILDING IN 1970. THIS WAS AN ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM AND WAS FOLLOWED BY
AUTOMATION OF MOST TECHNICAL ROUTINES. UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS THE LIBRARY USER
INFORMATION SERVICE, (LUIS), A SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ON-LINE SEARCHING IN THE
LIBRARY'S CATALOGUE OF ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1970. THE CARD CATALOGUE IS,
HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED MEANTIME AS LUIS DOES NOT ALLOW SUBJECT SEARCHES,
NOR HAS FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS. ALTHOUGH COST EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATION
PRIOR TO ITS INTRODUCTION HAD NOT BEEN CONSIDERED THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SMOOTHLY
INSTALLED AND HAD LED TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT.
THERE WAS GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE FACT THAT THE LIBRARY HAD BEEN AB LE
TO CREATE A WELL FUNCTIONING, INDEPENDENT SYSTEM.
