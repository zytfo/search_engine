CONVENTIONAL CATALOGUING TECHNIQUES AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
TAKING THE CATALOGUING OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS USING PRACTICES EVOLVED FOR
PRINTED DOCUMENTS AS A STARTING POINT, CONSIDERS THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON
RESEARCH WHEN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED THROUGH THE
RESTRICTED APPROACHES PERMITTED BY STANDARD REDUCTIVE CATALOGUING CODES.
ATTEMPTS TO APPLY CONVENTIONAL CATALOGUING PROCEDURES TO AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL
REQUIRE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF IMAGES AND SOUNDS INTO TEXTUAL EQUIVALENTS, FOR
INTEGRATION WITH THE EXISTING COLLECTION OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTS. SEARCHING BY
PURELY VISUAL OR AUDIO QUALITIES IS IMPOSSIBLE. EQUALLY, WRITTEN DOCUMENTS CAN
ONLY BE ACCESSED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ESTABLISHED APPROACHES. REFERENCE IS
MADE TO RECENT PUBLISHED DISCUSSION OF PROBLEMS IN AUDIO-VISUAL CATALOGUING
AND STRATEGIES TO SOLVE THEM.
