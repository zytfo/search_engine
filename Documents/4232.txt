A TALE OF TIFFANY WINDOWS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW, IN THE 1920S, SEVERAL SECULAR STAINED GLASS WINDOWS PLACED IN
THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLASSROOM BUILDING OF BLOOMSBURG STATE COLLEGE,
PENNSYLVANIA, IMPROVED STUDENT ATTITUDES AND MODERATED NOISE LEVELS. OUTLINES
THE BACKGROUND TO THE PURCHASE OF THESE WINDOWS, THREE OF WHICH WERE DESIGNED
BY LOUIS C. TIFFANY. THESE WINDOWS ARE NOW INCORPORATED INTO THE DESIGN OF THE
NEW COLLEGE LIBRARY, WHERE, IT IS THOUGHT, THEY MAINTAIN A PLEASANT AESTHETIC
ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING.
