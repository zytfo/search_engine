ISSUES IN SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRITAIN: A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE.

PRESENTS IMPRESSIONS GAINED BY A CANADIAN DURING A 2-WEEK BRITISH COUNCIL
STUDY TOUR OF UK SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN APR 80 AND COMPARES THE UK AND CANADIAN
SCENARIOS. THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN IS A LIBRARIAN 1ST IN THE UK, A TEACHER 1ST IN
CANADA. UK SCHOOL LIBRARIANS SPEND PRECIOUS TIME SELECTING AND CATALOGUING
MATERIALS; CANADIANS RELY ON SELECTION AIDS AND SPEND TIME ON IN-SERVICE
PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO GIVE IDEAS ON USE OF MATERIAL. PROFESSIONAL POLITICS IN
THE UK ARE DESTRUCTIVE. THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE DECISIVE FOR UK SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS WHO MUST DEFINE THEIR GOALS AND DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE PART OF
EDUCATION OR THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
