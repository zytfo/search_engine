LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT RELATING TO 'LIBRARY MATERIALS' IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW
MEDIA ACT.

THE AUSTRIAN LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT WAS DUE FOR REFORM, PARTLY TO BRING UP TO
DATE THE PRICE LIMITS FOR BOOKS DEPOSITED, AND PARTLY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE TO
INCLUDE MULTI-MEDIA CATEGORIES. THE NEW ACT, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN JUNE 81,
IS CRITICISED FOR ITS EXCLUSION OF NON-BOOK MATERIALS (ESPECIALLY FILMS) IN
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE AUSTRIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION,
SINCE JULY 81, TO MAINTAIN MULTI-MEDIA ARCHIVES. THERE IS ALSO CRITICISM OF
THE INCLUSION OF PARLIAMENT AS A DEPOSIT LIBRARY, OF THE EXTENDED CATEGORIES
OF EXEMPTION AND OF THE DECISION TO ALLOW PUBLISHERS 1 MONTH IN WHICH TO
DEPOSIT INSTEAD OF 8 DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY.
