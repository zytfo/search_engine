MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT FROM ONLINE SEARCHES.

MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT (MRO) FROM ON-LINE SEARCHES IS USEFUL IN THE
COMPILATION OF LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIES. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH A MAJOR
ON-LINE RETRIEVAL VENDOR TO OBTAIN (FOR A FEE) OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF MAGNETIC
TAPE, RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL OFF-LINE PRINTS ON PAPER. A PROGRAMME WAS
WRITTEN TO TRANSFORM AND PROCESS THE DATA; PART OF THIS PROGRAMME IS SIMILAR
TO A COMPUTER COMPILER. A METHOD OF CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ITEMS WAS
DEVELOPED. MRO IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATES THE TIME-CONSUMING AND
LABOUR-INTENSIVE DATA ENTRY PROCESS. IT IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE POWERS
OF ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
