EVALUATION OF A COOPERATIVE VENTURE PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT IN THE LATE 60S
AND 70S BY 10 MID-WEST LIBERAL ART COLLEGES. THEIR LIBRARY SERVICE AND CENTRAL

IN MINNESOTA AND LATER SOLD TO THE ILLINOIS NORTH SUBURBAN LIBRARY SYSTEM,
WHICH SERVES A MUCH LARGER CLIENTELE AND COULD THUS PROVIDE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
BASED ON HIGH-VOLUME BORROWING AND LARGE COLLECTIONS.
