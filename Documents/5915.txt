A SURVEY OF ON-LINE SEARCH SERVICE CENTERS IN CANADA.

THIS SURVEY OF ON-LINE SEARCH SERVICE CENTRES IN CANADA WAS CONDUCTED TO
PROVIDE DATA ON THESE CENTRES AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, ON THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE HUMAN SEARCH INTERMEDIARY, AND TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE OVERALL PICTURE
OF ON-LINE SEARCHING IN CANADA. THE SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES WERE MAILED TO
APPROXIMATELY 765 CANADIAN CUSTOMERS OF 7 COMMERCIAL ON-LINE VENDORS AND
YIELDED A RESPONSE RATE OF 49.7%. QUESTIONS ON THE SURVEY WERE DIVIDED INTO 2
PARTS' DATA ON THE SEARCH SERVICE CENTRE ITSELF, AND DATA ON SEARCH
INTERMEDIARIES. FINDINGS WERE ANALYSED FOR EACH QUESTION USING FREQUENCY
DISTRIBUTIONS, AND CROSS TABULATIONS WERE PERFORMED ON SOME GROUPS OF
QUESTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
