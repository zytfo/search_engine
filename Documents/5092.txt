AUDIO-VISUAL DEVELOPMENTS RELEVANT TO LIBRARIES.

MOST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY ALREADY HAVE MANY AUDIO-VISUAL (AV)
AIDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL' MICROFILMS, SOUND RECORDINGS IN VARIOUS FORMS, MAPS,
POSTERS AND INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES FOR LISTENING TO SOUND RECORDINGS. TODAY THE
MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF AV AIDS IN LIBRARIES IS NOT THE INTRODUCTION OF EVERY
AVAILABLE NEW AV DEVELOPMENT INTO THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A MEDIA SECTION IN THE LIBRARY WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS
WITHIN THE LIBRARY E.G. THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT. NEW DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS
VIEWDATA, VIDEO, CABLE TELEVISION AND COMPUTER LEARNING AIDS CANNOT BE
AUTOMATICALLY INTEGRATED INTO LIBRARIES. VARIOUS FACTORS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION WHEN SELECTING A NEW AV AID FOR A LIBRARY; THE INFORMATION
VALUE, ECONOMIC ASPECTS, AND THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL STAFF TRAINING WHICH
WILL BE NECESSARY TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE AIDS.
