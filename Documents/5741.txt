AN ENERGY-CONSCIOUS LIBRARY BUILDING IN KATWIJK.

ON 14 DEC 80, A NEW BRANCH LIBRARY WAS OPENED AT KATWIJK IN THE NETHERLANDS.
DURING THE PLANNING STAGES IT WAS FELT THAT A BUILDING WITH A PUBLIC FUNCTION,
SUCH AS A PUBLIC LIBRARY, SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE IN ENERGY SAVING. TO MAXIMISE
NATURAL ENERGY FROM THE SUN THE BUILDING HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A LARGE
AREA OF GLASS IN THE SOUTH-EAST WALL; THE WARMTH GENERATED BY THIS MEANS IS
RETAINED IN THE STONE NORTH WALL AND THE FLOOR. THE BUILDING IS EQUIPPED WITH
TRIPLE-GLAZING AND HEAT-INSULATING BLINDS WHICH CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY AT NIGHT
AND REOPEN EACH MORNING. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SAVINGS IN ENERGY COSTS WILL
BE IN THE REGION OF 50%. IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS WILL FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE.
