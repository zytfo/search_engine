THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF SPORT, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION STAFF
AND HOW LIBRARIANS CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.
     
THE PARTICULAR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION STAFF IN
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE OFTEN IGNORED OR NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY
LIBRARIANS. THE SUBJECT CONCERNS OF SUCH PEOPLE EMBRACE ELEMENTS FROM ALL THE
MAJOR DISCIPLINES. A SURVEY OF STAFF INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT RESEARCH IN
SPORT, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION IN UK UNIVERSITIES AND IN CERTAIN
POLYTECHNICS AND RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS REVEALED THAT' JUST UNDER 50% HAD NOT
USED AN ABSTRACTING/INDEXING JOURNAL IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WORK; WELL UNDER
20% HAD USED A COMPUTER-BASED SEARCH SYSTEM; 60% HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY KIND OF
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTRUCTION, BUT MOST OF THIS GROUP BELIEVED INSTRUCTION WOULD
HAVE HELPED THEM; 80% WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ALLOW LIBRARIANS TO CARRY OUT
LITERATURE SEARCHES; 20% COULD NOT 'READ' IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND ONLY A
MINORITY OF THOSE WHO COULD, ACTUALLY SCANN ED MATERIAL IN THE LANGUAGE.
