SUMMARY TO SECTION DEVOTED TO INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF SELECTED
PROFESSIONALS).C
     
ONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF SELECTED
PROFESSIONALS. SUMMARISES THE INTERVIEW FINDINGS OF THE 5 PAPERS IN THIS
SPECIAL SECTION. EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS HIS SPECIAL INFORMATION NEEDS AND EACH
WORKS IN A FIELD IN WHICH CURRENT INFORMATION IS BOTH ESSENTIAL AND OFTEN HARD
TO LOCATE. CO-WORKERS ARE THE MOST OFTEN CONSULTED INFORMATION SOURCES, AND
LIBRARIES WERE RARELY IF EVER USED FOR ON THE JOB NEEDS-PERHAPS THERE IS
LITTLE OR NO ROLE FOR THE LIBRARY IN THIS SPHERE FOR MANY WORKERS. LIBRARY
STAFF, TOO, CONSULT CO-WORKERS WHEN PLANNING THE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE
ACTIVITIES. POTENTIAL USERS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED. LIBRARIANS NEED TO KNOW THE
EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN FILL THOSE NEEDS.
