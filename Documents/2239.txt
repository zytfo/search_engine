SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TECHNIQUES. THE USE OF 2SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1 TO STUDY
THE DISSEMINATION DYNAMICS OF AFFINE CHROMATOGRAPHY.
     
EXPLORES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING 2SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1 TO ANALYSE RESEARCH
METHOD TRANSFER DYNAMICS, USING THE EXAMPLE OF AFFINE CHROMATOGRAPHY. THE
DISSEMINATION OF 2 VERSIONS OF THIS TECHNIQUE (DEVELOPED IN SWEDEN AND THE
USA) IS STUDIED; THE COMMUNICATION LINKS USED BY THE ORIGINATORS OF THE
METHODS ARE UNCOVERED; AND THE INFORMATION ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE
ORIGINATORS CONCERNING THEIR METHOD'S USE IN RESEARCH ARE DESCRIBED. SUCH
STUDIES COULD BE USED TO COMPARE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY OF SCIENCE IN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
