INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

A TRUE ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIRES BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF AT LEAST 350-400
CHARACTERS PER TITLE, A MINIMUM OF 6 ACCESS POINTS, AND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
TERMINALS TO OFFER ALL USERS PROMPT ACCESS. A LIBRARY MAY DEVELOP AN ON-LINE
CATALOGUE BY PURCHASING SOFTWARE FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY OR JOINING A TURNKEY
SYSTEM WHEREBY A COMPANY PROVIDES ALL HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION,
TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE AT A CONTRACTED PRICE. ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN
EXAMINING THE OPTIONS INCLUDE DATA BASE CONTENT, FULLNESS OF RECORDS,
AUTHORITY CONTROL, ACCESS KEYS, BOOLEAN LOGIC, USER FRIENDLINESS, DISPLAY
FORMATS, SECURITY, AND BACK-UP PROVISION. LIBRARIES UNDERTAKING ON-LINE
CATALOGUES IN 1981 ARE PIONEERS.
