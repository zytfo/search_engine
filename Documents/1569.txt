LIBRARIES AND THE UNITED NATION'S INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED IN A
PRESENT AND FUTURE LIBRARY CONTEXT. LIBRARIES MUST ASSIST HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
TO TAKE PART IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY ON EQUAL TERMS
WITH EVERYONE ELSE, BUT THIS MEANS THAT THEY MUST HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE
INFORMATION AND EXPRESSIVE HUMAN EXPERIENCE CAUGHT BY THE PRINTED WORD. A
TOTAL OR PARTIAL READING HANDICAP WILL HINDER THIS ACCESS. TO THE LIBRARY
FALLS THE TASK OF BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT THOSE WITH A
READING HANDICAP FROM GAINING ACCESS TO THE MESSAGE CONTAINED BY WORDS IN
PRINT.
