CONCEPTS OF REFERENCE SERVICE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
TO ASCERTAIN THE ATTITUDES OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
TOWARDS REFERENCE SERVICE, AN ENQUIRY BASED ON PERSONAL INTERVIEWS AND
QUESTIONNAIRES WAS CARRIED OUT DURING PART OF 1979 AND 80. THE SURVEY
POPULATION WAS SELECTED FROM THE 3 MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND 3 OF THE
LARGER COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION LIBRARIES. INTERVIEWS WERE DESIGNED TO
PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ATTITUDES TO REFERENCE PROVISION, AND QUESTIONNAIRES
SOUGHT TO MEASURE RESPONDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS SPECIFIC REFERENCE SERVICES
AS EXPRESSED BY THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF AN OPINION OF SUCH A SERVICE.
FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND ON THE JOB TRAINING MAY BE
BOTH HAPHAZARD AND INEFFECTUAL. IT APPEARS THAT A REASSESSMENT OF THE WHOLE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING MIGHT BE IN ORDER.
