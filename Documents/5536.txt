THE USER IN LIBRARIANSHIP CURRICULA.

EXTRACT FROM A POSTGRADUATE DISSERTATION PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. WITHIN THE DISCIPLINE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, USER STUDIES ARE AN IMPORTANT
RESEARCH TOPIC, BUT THERE IS LITTLE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF USERS IN LIBRARIANSHIP
CURRICULA. TO ESTABLISH HOW THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT AREA SHOULD BE TREATED IN
TRAINING PROGRAMMES, AN ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE LITERATURE DEALING WITH
USERS, TO ESTABLISH A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR TEACHING PURPOSES. RESULTS SHOWED
THAT THE PRIMARY FOCUS WAS ON USER BEHAVIOUR IN RELATION TO SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL FACTORS; NEEDS AND MOTIVATIONS; AND INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION IN
THE LIBRARY SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, DRAWING ON,
FOR EXAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGY, ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY, SHOULD BE ADOPTED.
