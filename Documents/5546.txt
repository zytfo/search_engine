IDEAL STAFF FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. WITH REFERENCE TO THE SITUATION AT THE HELSINKI (FINLAND) UNIVERSITY OF
TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES, OFFERS A PERSONAL VIEW ON TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS OF
STAFF IN SUCH LIBRARIES. EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIC TRAINING IN
ENGINEERING, PHYSICS, AND CHEMISTRY; THE NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES; AND
THE NEED FOR EDUCATION IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. SUGGESTS THE OPTION
OF AN EARLIER RETIREMENT AGE FOR LIBRARY STAFF SO THAT NEW STAFF MEMBERS ARE
AS YOUNG, SERVICE-MINDED, AND NON-BUREAUCRATIC AS POSSIBLE.
