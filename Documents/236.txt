INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

MANY INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN DEVELOPING AND
COORDINATING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. SOME OF THESE
ORGANISATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED METHODS, AND PARTICULAR TERMINOLOGY. THERE IS NO
ESTABLISHED DIVISION OF WORK BETWEEN THESE ORGANISATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CAN BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE MORE MECHANICAL THIS EXCHANGE IS THE MORE ECONOMICAL
AND FASTER IT WILL BE. UNISIST NOW ALSO COVERS SOCIAL SCIENCES. A PLAN
PUBLISHED IN 1972 INCLUDES UNESCO'S PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. UNESCO ALSO SUPPORTS FINANCIALLY SOME
PROJECTS IN THE FIELD, INCLUDING ECSSID PROGRAMME. IN 1975 OECD MAPPED THE
AVAILABLE INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD IN EUROPE. BETWEEN 1971 AND 1980
THE BRITISH DISISS PROJECT LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL
SCIENCES AND THEIR QUALITY. BOTH PROJECTS CONCLUDED  THAT INFORMATION SERVICES
HAVE DEVELOPED WITHOUT ANY GENERAL LONG-TERM PLAN. 2 RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE
FIELD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN FINLAND.
