THE LIBRARY AS LYCEUM.
     
THANKS TO GRANTS FROM THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES (NEH), OHOOPEE
REGIONAL LIBRARY IN VIDALIA, GEORGIA (POPULATION 11,200), ORGANISED 5
PROGRAMMES IN 26 MONTHS. THEY WERE ABOUT THE OCCULT, DEATH, SCIENCE FICTION,
THE NOBEL PRIZE, AND THE ART OF THE SHORT STORY, AND FEATURED VISITS FROM
PROMINENT AUTHORS AND ACADEMICS. EXPLAINS HOW A SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD
APPLY FOR A NEH GRANT FOR PROGRAMMES; DESCRIBES HOW TO PLAN A PROGRAMME,
APPROACH SPEAKERS, OBTAIN LOCAL FUNDING, AND MOUNT A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN; AND
STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH VENTURES IN SMALL COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE IS
NO OTHER INSTITUTION TO OFFER THEM.
