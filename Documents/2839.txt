ON THE HANDLING OF DEPOSITORY COPIES.
     
ON 5 DEC 78 THE GERMAN LIBRARY (DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK) HELD A COLLOQUIUM
CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF DEPOSITORY COPIES OF MATERIAL TO LIBRARIES IN WEST
GERMANY. THE LAWS GOVERNING DEPOSITORY COPIES WERE CRITICISED AS BEING TOO
VARIED AND INEXACT, DEMANDS WERE MADE FOR STRICTER LAWS TO COVER ALL TYPES OF
MATERIAL OF VALUE AS DEPOSITORY COPIES. MORE LIBRARY POSTS FOR STAFF DEALING
SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS ASPECT OF LIBRARY WORK SHOULD BE CREATED. MOST
LIBRARIES CONCENTRATE ON COLLECTING CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF PUBLICATIONS AND
TEND TO NEGLECT INNOVATIONS SUCH AS MICROFORMS.
