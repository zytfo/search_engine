BOOK PRESERVATION QUESTIONS ANSWERED AT CONFERENCE.
     
REPORT ON THE FINDINGS OF A CONFERENCE, ON BOOK PRESERVATION SPONSORED BY THE
COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES AND THE ANDREW MELLON FOUNDATION. THE NEED FOR
FURTHER PROGRESS WAS EMPHASISED, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THERE WAS A FOUNDATION
ON WHICH TO BUILD. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS REASONABLE
TO BALANCE THE PHYSICAL DURABILITY OF BOOKS AND THEIR INTELLECTUAL AND
CULTURAL WORTH. DISCUSSION TOPICS INCLUDED PERMANENCE AND DURABILITY OF PAPER,
ITS AVAILABILITY AND COSTS, CATEGORIES OF BOOKS AND JOURNALS TO BE ROUTINELY
MANUFACTURED ON PERMANENT AND DURABLE PAPER, PROMOTION OF ALKALINE AND DURABLE
PAPERS OUTSIDE THE US, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MANUFACTURING COPIES OF BOOKS
FOR LIBRARIES SEPARATELY.
