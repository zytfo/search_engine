ESSEN WORKSHOP 1981' TRAINING READERS IN THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, 1-3
APRIL 1981.
     
LECTURES WERE GIVEN ON TRAINING READERS IN THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL AT
HOME AND ABROAD. FORMS OF TRAINING CAN BE VERY VARIED; THE CHOICE OF MEDIA
USED DEPENDS ON THE READER'S PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AND ON ECONOMIC
AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS. AT THE CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,
GOTEBORG, THE LIBRARY PROVIDES A BASIC INTRODUCTION FOR 1ST TIME USERS, A 14
HOUR COURSE ON LIBRARY SEARCH TECHNIQUES AND AN ADVANCED COURSE ON INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL. THE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE ON 'LEARNING BY DOING'. THE COLLECTION AND
INFORMATION CENTRE FOR AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA PLANNED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY WAS
DESCRIBED AND A DISCUSSION WAS HELD ON THE MERITS AND DEMERITS OF DIFFERENT
MEDIA. MORE COOPERATION IS REQUIRED BETWEEN MEDIA PRODUCERS AND LIBRARIANS.
