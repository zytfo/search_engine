NESSEBY LIBRARY' A BIG EFFORT FOR A SMALL AUTHORITY.
     
NESSEBY, IN NORTHERN NORWAY, IS LARGE IN AREA (1,438 SQ.KIL.) BUT SMALL IN
POPULATION (1,120 INHABITANTS). AFTER MANY YEARS OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY
ACCOMMODATION, A NEW COMMUNITY CENTRE INCLUDING A LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN 1980,
SO WELCOME THAT THE INCREASED FINANCIAL BURDEN IS NOT RESENTED. THE LIBRARY IS
IN THE BASEMENT, BUT SLOPING GROUND ALLOWS AMPLE WINDOW SPACE. FOR THE 1ST
TIME THERE IS A LOAN COUNTER, A LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE, AND ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE
4,500 BOOKS. THE ADDITION OF A PROPOSED MOBILE LIBRARY WOULD ENSURE A GOOD
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE AREA, THOUGH EXPANSION WILL BE NECESSARY IN TIME.
