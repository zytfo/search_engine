GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZE
OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES.
