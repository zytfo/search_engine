EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE-SCALE RELEGATION OF BOOKS FROM
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. INDICATORS OF USE AND NON-USE ARE DEVELOPED FOR GENERAL
APPLICATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RELEGATION OF PERIODICALS IS CONSIDERABLY

THE RELEGATION OF MONOGRAPHS. THE RELEVANCE TO A LOCAL LIBRARY SITUATION OF
BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION DATA ON PERIODICAL USAGE IS VINDICATED.
