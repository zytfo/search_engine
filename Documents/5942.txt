WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY' HUMANITIES PROGRAMMING FOR THE PUBLIC.

MORGANTOWN PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS 1 OF 10 PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE IN
RADCLIFFE COLLEGE'S WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY PROJECT. A WEEK-LONG TRAINING
SESSION INCLUDED DISCUSSION OF HOW NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WOMEN IS CHANGING THE
PERCEPTION OF HISTORY AND OTHER ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES. THERE WERE SESSIONS ON
PROGRAMME PLANNING, OUTREACH, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND FORMATS, AND MORGANTOWN
WILL PLAN AND IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF 4-6 PROGRAMMES ON WOMEN IN SPRING AND
EARLY SUMMER 82. INCLUDED IN PROVISIONAL PLANS ARE A PHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION,
ORAL HISTORY AND REMINISCENCES OF WOMEN FOCUSING ON WAR FROM THE CIVIL WAR TO
MODERN TIMES. PROGRAMMES WILL DRAW ON THE MANY FORMS OF ARCHIVAL MATERIAL
AVAILABLE IN THE AREA.
