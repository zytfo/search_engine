ON COSTING ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS FOR COM-FICHE CATALOGUES.
     
AN ALGEBRAIC MODEL RELATING CATALOGUE COSTS TO THE NUMBER OF EXISTING TITLES,
NEW TITLES AND TITLES PROCESSED IS DEVELOPED. THE NUMBER OF TITLES PROCESSED
IS THEN RELATED TO THE CUMULATION AND CONSOLIDATION FREQUENCIES SO THAT THE
EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CUMULATION PATTERNS CAN BE CALCULATED. THIS SHOWS THAT
ANNUAL CONSOLIDATION IS SENSIBLE IN SEVERAL SITUATIONS. VARIATIONS IN OTHER
FACTORS ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXPLICITLY BUT A COMPUTER SIMULATION MODEL IS
DESCRIBED WHICH COULD BE USED TO INVESTIGATE ANY SET OF REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVES.
