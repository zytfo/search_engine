INTERACTIVE MONITORING OF COMPUTER-BASED GROUP COMMUNICATION. PAPER P-71.
     
THE INTERACTIVE MONITORING OF GROUP COMMUNICATION THROUGH COMPUTERS IS A
PROCEDURE ANALOGOUS TO BIOFEEDBACK, AND SMALL GROUP COMMUNICATION COMPUTER
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE MEDIUM ON GROUP
COMMUNICATION. THERE IS PRESENTLY NO TECHNICAL REASON THAT SUCH INFORMATION
COULD NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO USERS OF COMPUTER CONFERENCING. AN INTERACTIVE
MONITOR WOULD ALLOW THE GROUP TO SPOT POSSIBLE COMMUNICATION BARRIERS AND THEN
DETERMINE PROPER INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS, THUS PROVIDING AN
EVALUATION AND ALTERATION MECHANISM. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
