EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS ON A COMPUTER INTERFACE TO AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
NETWORK.
     
A PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP AN INTERFACE THAT WOULD PROVIDE
DIRECT ACCESS FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS TO EXISTING ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL NETWORKS. THE EXPERIMENT TESTED THE CONCEPT OF A
VIRTUAL-SYSTEM MODE OF ACCESS TO A NETWORK OF HETEROGENEOUS INTERACTIVE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA BASES. AN EXPERIMENTAL TRANSLATING COMPUTER
INTERFACE NAMED CONIT WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESEARCH TEST VEHICLE. THE INTERFACE
WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF 3 DIFFERENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS EASY TO USE, EVEN BY INEXPERIENCED USERS, BY PROVIDING A
SIMPLIFIED COMMON COMMAND LANGUAGE COUPLED WITH EXTENSIVE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION.
