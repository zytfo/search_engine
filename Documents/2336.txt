AN EXAMINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO SUCCESS OF FRIENDS GROUPS IN
MEDICAL SCHOOL RARE BOOK LIBRARIES.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON D.C., 18 JUNE 80. PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF
A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO DISCOVER HOW EFFECTIVE FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS ARE
AS SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR US MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARIES. CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARY AND OF FRIENDS GROUPS WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY
THOSE WHICH ARE CORRELATED WITH SUCCESSFUL FRIENDS GROUPS. CORRELATIONS WERE
FOUND BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CONTRIBUTED BY THE FRIENDS GROUP AND THE AGE
OF THE GROUP; THE LIBRARIAN'S PARTICIPATION IN FORMING IT; AND THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY SPENT BY THE LIBRARY ON THE GROUP. RECOMMENDS WAYS OF INCREASING THE
LEVEL OF DONATIONS FROM FRIENDS GROUPS, AND OF MANAGING THESE FUNDS MORE
EFFECTIVELY.
