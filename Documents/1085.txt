BENEFIT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY: THE KEY PRIORITY FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH.

BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S BOOK, DO WE REALLY NEED LIBRARIES (SEE 81/3169).
DISCUSSES 2 RECENT STUDIES IN WHICH THE QUESTION OF MONEY VALUES WAS
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED AND AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO JUDGE A LIBRARY'S PERFORMANCE
BY ASSESSING (1) HOW WELL IT WAS GETTING THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMERS AT WHOM THE
SERVICE WAS AIMED AND (2) WHAT IMPACT THE SERVICE HAD ON THOSE EXPOSED TO IT.
THE 2 ESTABLISHMENTS THUS EVALUATED WERE THE ACCESS LIBRARY OF THE GREATER
LONDON COUNCIL (UK) AND THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE BRITISH
INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT.
