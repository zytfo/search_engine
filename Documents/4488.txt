THE LIBRARIANS' UNION AND FUTURE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
A GROUP OF STUDENTS AT THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL CRITICISES THE LIBRARIANS'
UNION FOR LACK OF POLICY ON EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT
OF A COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, AND URGES IT TO INITIATE A DEBATE
AMONG THE MEMBERS. THE GROUP PRESENTS ITS OWN SUGGESTIONS' MINOR SUBJECTS
SHOULD BE GATHERED IN LARGER SUBJECT GROUPS; ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN
TEACHING OF THE TREND TO LIBRARIES STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN; THE USE OF
COMPUTERS SHOULD NOT BE A SUBJECT ON ITS OWN, BUT TAUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
ALL SUBJECT AREAS; TEACHING OF RUSSIAN COULD BE CONFINED TO TEACHING OF
TRANSLITERATION UNDER CATALOGUING; THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SHOULD GIVE A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR SEARCHING WITHIN ANY SUBJECT
AREA AND NOT AIM TO GIVE THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULAR SUBJECTS; AND THE
NEW UNIFIED COURSE SHOULD NOT INCLUDE SPECIALISATION, BUT EMPHASISE THE COMMON
ASPECTS OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARI ANSHIP.
