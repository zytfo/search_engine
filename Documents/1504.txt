EXTENDING SCHOOL LIBRARY AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES TO A SCATTERED
POPULATION' PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
     
IT WILL BE APPARENT FROM THE PROBLEMS FACING PAPUA NEW GUINEA TODAY; THE
OBSTACLES FOUND IN THE TERRAIN, THE INADEQUATE ROAD SYSTEMS, THE CULTURAL AND
LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY, THE UNEQUAL SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ITS
PEOPLE, THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY SERVICE, EVEN AT THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL LEVEL, AND THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE PEOPLE'S
WAY OF LIFE AND HELPFUL IN A TIME OF URGENT CHANGE, IS AN ENORMOUS TASK. TO
SPEAK OF EXTENDING SERVICES WHERE ALMOST NONE EXIST WOULD BE TO IGNORE THE
REALITIES AFFECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND OTHER MEANS OF
KEEPING PEOPLE INFORMED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF PRINT. SOME PROPOSALS FOR
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO ENABLE THEM TO SERVE THE
COMMUNITY IN DIFFERENT WAYS ARE OFFERED.
