DOCUMENTATION SPECIALISTS AND QUEBEC GOVERNMENT POLICY ON SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION.

DISCUSSES RECENT QUEBEC GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL
INFORMATION NETWORK, AND THE REACTIONS OF THE 2 CHIEF QUEBEC LIBRARIANS
ASSOCIATIONS, ASTED AND CBPQ. GOVERNMENT POLICY AS SET FORTH IN A RECENT WHITE
PAPER IS OUTLINED, AND THE RESPONSES FROM ASTED AND CBPQ SUMMARISED. THE
GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO DEMOCRATISE SCIENCE BY EDUCATION AND POPULARISATION IS
GENERALLY APPROVED, BUT CRITICISM IS MADE OF THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
PROCEDURES. IN EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY OF LOCAL DECISION-MAKING IN THE
CREATION OF INFORMATION NETWORKS, THE IMPORTANCE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND A
GLOBAL ORIENTATION IS BEING IGNORED.
