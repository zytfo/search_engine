USER EDUCATION-FOR LIFE?.

USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES FALL INTO 2 CATEGORIES. THEY MAY AIM SIMPLY TO HELP
THE STUDENT THROUGH HIS COURSE AND FAMILIARISE HIM WITH A SINGLE LIBRARY
(SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES), OR TO PROVIDE A FULLER AWARENESS OF THE GENERATION,
ROLE, AND USE OF INFORMATION WHICH MAY ALLOW HIM TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN ANY
SUBSEQUENT PROFESSIONAL SITUATION (LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES). ARGUES THAT THE
LATTER ARE MORE VALUABLE; THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARIAN AND STUDENT ON SUCH
COURSES ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. A USER EDUCATION COURSE BASED ON LONG-TERM
OBJECTIVES IS DESCRIBED, AND ITS EFFECTS ON STUDENT AND LIBRARY DISCUSSED.
FINALLY, THE CONTRIBUTION OF USER EDUCATION TO THE 'INFORMATION SOCIETY' IS
CONSIDERED, AND USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES WITH LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES PREFERRED.
