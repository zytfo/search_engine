POLITICS, LIBRARIES AND UAP.
     
THE FIRST ISSUE OF 2SLJ' SOCIALIST LIBRARIANS JOURNAL1 CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A
NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON LIBRARIANSHIP FROM A SOCIALIST VIEWPOINT,
BUT FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC TENETS OF SOCIALIST LIBRARIANSHIP. REVIEWS SOME
OF THE RECENT LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC, AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES MUST,
THROUGH FREE ACCESS AND UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS), ALLOW
EVERY THINKING PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN OPINION OF THE WORLD
AND THE SOCIETY ROUND THEM. WHILST 2SLJ1 LACKS INGENUITY AND IS OFTEN
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, IT ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE THAT SOCIALISM MUST REQUIRE A
SOLID PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
