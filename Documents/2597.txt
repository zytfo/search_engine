RESEARCH LIBRARIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF VIENNA.
     
UNLIKE MANY OTHER GERMAN SPEAKING DIOCESES, VIENNA HAS NO DIOCESAN LIBRARY AS
SUCH BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES ATTACHED TO VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS
BESIDES THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ADMINISTERED BY THE CHURCH. BRIEF HISTORIES ARE
GIVEN OF THE 9 EXISTING ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF THE DIOCESE. THE SEMINARY
LIBRARY IS THE LARGEST, WITH 65,000 VOLUMES AND THE ARCHDIOCESAN LIBRARY IS
THE OLDEST, FOUNDED IN 15TH CENTURY, AND HOUSING 30,000 VOLUMES. OTHER
LIBRARIES ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND QUITE SMALL. MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN THEM
WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AS WELL AS GREATER COOPERATION WITH THE PUBLIC
SECTOR.
