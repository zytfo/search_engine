TOY LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA. A REPORT WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEIR ROLE IN
SERVICES FOR YOUNG HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE GROWTH OF TOY LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN RAPID AND EXTENSIVE DURING
THE 70S AND TOY LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES.
HOWEVER, EVIDENCE POINTS TO A LACK OF AWARENESS ON THE PART OF LAY PEOPLE AND
PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF TOY LIBRARIES; ESPECIALLY IN
THEIR ROLE OF SERVING HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE AIM OF THE
STUDY IS TO HELP OVERCOME THIS LACK OF INFORMATION AND BE OF ASSISTANCE TO
POLICY MAKERS AND THOSE DEVELOPING SERVICES WHICH IMPINGE ON AREAS IN WHICH
TOY LIBRARIES ARE PRESENTLY INVOLVED.
