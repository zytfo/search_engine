OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS AUTOMATED IN SWEDEN.

PHILIPS OF THE NETHERLANDS HAS DELIVERED THE 1ST OF 30 DSX-40 SWITCHING
SYSTEMS TO THE SWEDISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADMINISTRATION. THE DSX-40 IS AN
'OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS CONTROLLER', I.E. A COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTER FOR TELEX,
TEXT, AND DATA TRAFFIC. SWEDEN HAS DECIDED TO INSTALL THE SYSTEM AS PART OF
ITS PLANS FOR THE AUTOMATED OFFICE OF THE FUTURE. INITIALLY, THE DSX-40 WILL
BE USED TO AUTOMATE TELEX PROCEDURES WHICH HAVE BEEN PERFORMED MANUALLY IN THE
PAST. FOR THE FUTURE, THE SYSTEM COULD FUNCTION AS THE ELECTRONIC POSTMAN IN A
NON-VOICE INTER-OFFICE NETWORK.
