ZZZZ.

THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT HAS, THROUGH THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION, APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO PLAN A SYSTEM OF CENTRAL
LIBRARIES. FIRSTLY, AN INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS OF THE SWEDISH INFORMATION
SYSTEM WILL BE CARRIED OUT; THEN A MODEL FOR A CENTRAL LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL
PROBABLY BE TESTED; AND FINALLY THE COMMITTEE WILL PRODUCE A PROPOSAL FOR SUCH
A SYSTEM, WITH EACH CENTRAL LIBRARY RESPONSIBLE FOR A CERTAIN AREA OF THE
TOTAL NATIONAL HOLDINGS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE.
