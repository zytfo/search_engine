PRESTEL TO TRANSMIT COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS.

BRITISH TELECOM, PART OF THE POST OFFICE, HAS DEMONSTRATED PROTOTYPE PICTURE
PRESTEL CAPABLE OF DISPLAYING FULL-COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS, ACCOMPANIED BY TEXT.
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO POTENTIAL OVERSEAS PURCHASERS OF
PRESTEL AND TO COMPANIES WHO WISH TO OFFER PRIVATE VIEWDATA SERVICES. THE LATE
1980S IS PROBABLY THE EARLIEST DATE FOR THE WIDESPREAD INTRODUCTION OF PICTURE
PRESTEL. DETAILS OF DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED.
