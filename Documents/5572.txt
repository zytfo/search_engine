THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK IS WELL DEVELOPED AND REACHES LARGE GROUPS OF
THE POPULATION THROUGH ITS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT
ALMOST &H THE ADULT POPULATION AND 80-90% OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE VISITED A LIBRARY IN THE LAST YEAR. MODERN DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ACCELERATED
DURING THE 1970S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE FUSION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. SWEDEN
HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT, BUT THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT DECIDED TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM
OF STATE GRANTS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND REGIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. STATE
GRANTS AMOUNT TO 2.5% OF THE TOTAL OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT
THEY HAVE PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES THANKS TO THEIR
STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT.
