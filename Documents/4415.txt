COPYRIGHT AND THE NEW MEDIA.
     
DISCUSSES THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OF COPYRIGHT WHICH ARE
EMBODIED IN THE REVISION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON PROPOSED CHANGES IN THAT PART
OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT WHICH REFERS TO PRIVATE COPYING. THE MAJORITY WISH TO SEE
FREE COPYING IN SINGLE COPIES FOR PRIVATE USE, BUT TO RESTRICT PROFESSIONAL
MULTIPLE COPYING. THIS RESTRICTION IS PARTICULARLY AIMED AT THE NEW MEDIA'
SOUND AND VIDEOTAPES, WHICH HAVE LED TO MASS USE. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO ECONOMIC PROFIT FROM THEIR
WORKS AND THE RIGHT OF SOCIETY TO FREE ENJOYMENT OF CULTURAL VALUES. UPHOLDS
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE OWNER'S SOLE RIGHT, BUT POINTS TO WAYS OF SOLVING
COPYRIGHT CONFLICTS IN A MASS USE SITUATION VIA LICENCE AGREEMENTS. TODAY,
WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE COLLECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF WORKS OF ART POSSIBLE IT
IS NATURAL TO SEEK THESE AGREEMENTS WITH ORGANISATIONS RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL
ARTISTS. RECOMMENDS THAT SUCH LICENCE AGREEMENTS BE CONCL UDED, AND THAT
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ORGANISE THEMSELVES SO AS TO EASE THE ADMINISTRATION OF
AGREEMENTS.
