THE TEACHER'S ROLE IN LIBRARY USAGE.

TEACHERS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROMOTING LIBRARY USAGE. IT IS FOR THE
TEACHERS TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CULTIVATING THE READING HABIT, BY GIVING STUDENTS
LIBRARY ASSIGNMENTS TO MOTIVATE THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY. THE ROLE OF THE
TEACHER AND THAT OF THE LIBRARIAN ARE CLOSELY RELATED, AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
THE TEACHER TO KNOW THE LIBRARIAN'S JOB AND PROMOTE LIBRARY USAGE.
