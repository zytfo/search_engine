THE WORK OF A COUNTY DEPARTMENT.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
DESCRIBES THE WORK OF SWEDEN'S JAMTLAND COUNTY, WHICH COMPRISES 2
PROVINCES-JAMTLAND AND HARJEDALEN. THE COUNTY IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF DENMARK,
BUT WITH ONLY 135,000 INHABITANTS, 40% OF WHOM LIVE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF
OSTERSUND. DISTANCES BETWEEN TOWNS ARE VAST. THE OSTERSUND LIBRARY BECAME THE
OFFICIAL COUNTY LIBRARY IN 1947. COUNTY DEPARTMENT WORK VARIES FROM COUNTY TO
COUNTY, AND COMPARISONS SHOW THAT SWEDISH COUNTY DEPARTMENTS WORK MORE
FLEXIBLY THAN, SAY, FINLAND'S PROVINCIAL LIBRARIES.
