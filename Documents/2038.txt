SERIES OF MODULES. FOR EACH MODULE THE STUDENT RECEIVES A MINITEXT, A SET OF
READINGS AND A WORKBOOK. THE STUDENT MUST STUDY THE TEXT AND READINGS AND
COMPLETE THE WORKBOOK ASSIGNMENTS RELATED TO THIS MODULE. THE STUDENT PASSES
THE COURSE WHEN ALL COMPONENT MODULES ARE COMPLETED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE
STUDENT'S FACULTY ADVISOR. DISCUSSES THE REASONS FOR ABANDONING THE EARLIER
METHODS, THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRESENT FORMAT AND ITS ADVANTAGES AND
LIMITATIONS.
