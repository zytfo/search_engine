COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HARDWARE VERSUS SOFTWARE TEXT SEACH.
     
PRESENTS A HYBRID APPROACH TO DATA BASE TEXT SEARCHING, USING THE BEST
FEATURES OF INVERSION AND STREAMING SEARCHING TECHNIQUES TO MINIMISE DATA FLOW
AND OBTAIN COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITY. THE QUERY IS BROKEN INTO 2 PARTS
BASED UPON THE EXISTENCE OF TERMS (OFFENSIVE TERMS) HAVING LEADING OR IMBEDDED
'DON'T CARES'. THOSE DOCUMENTS SATISFYING THE PART OF THE QUERY WITHOUT
OFFENSIVE TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED VIA INVERSION. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE ACCESSED AND
THE OFFENSIVE TERMS ARE SEARCHED FOR VIA STREAMING. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF
THE 1ST SET OF SIMULATION RUNS IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENTERS PERFORMED
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON MACHINE PROCESSING POWER AND % OF TERMS WITH LEADING
VARIABLE-LENGTH 'DON'T CARES'.
