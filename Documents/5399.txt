THE MEASUREMENT OF TERM IMPORTANCE IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING.

THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF TERMS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION HAVE
BEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF TERM IMPORTANCE FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INDEXING
PURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, VERY RARE OR VERY FREQUENT TERMS ARE NORMALLY
BELIEVED TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN MEDIUM-FREQUENCY TERMS. RECENTLY AUTOMATIC
INDEXING THEORIES HAVE BEEN DEVISED THAT USE NOT ONLY THE TERM FREQUENCY
CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES OF THE TERMS. THE MAJOR
TERM-WEIGHTING THEORIES ARE 1ST BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE TERM PRECISION AND TERM
UTILITY WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TERMS
IN THE RELEVANT, AS OPPOSED TO THE NONRELEVANT, DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION ARE
THEN INTRODUCED. METHODS ARE SUGGESTED FOR ESTIMATING THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES
OF THE TERMS BASED ON THEIR OVERALL OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE
COLLECTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS ARE SHOWN COMPARING THE
WEIGHTING SYSTEMS USING THE TERM RELEVANCE PROPERTIES WITH THE MORE
CONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY-BASED METHODOLOGIES.
