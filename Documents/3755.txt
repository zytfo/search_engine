INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND TRENDS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION TRANSFER.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF THE ROLE AND MECHANISM OF SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION TRANSFER;
THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS OF INSTITUTIONS; SOME INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS WHICH PROMOTE INFORMATION TRANSFER; AND COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
TRANSFER SYSTEMS. CONCLUDES THAT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IS GAINING
MOMENTUM, IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR SMALL COUNTRIES TO DECIDE ON THEIR
PRIORITIES IN DEVELOPING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE LINKS; AND INFORMATION

RATHER THAN THE 'DO-IT-YOURSELF' ATTITUDE.
