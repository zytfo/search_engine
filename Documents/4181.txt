LIBRARY LONG-RANGE PLANNING' A SURVEY OF CURRENT PRACTICES.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF LIBRARY DIRECTORS IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI REVEALS
THAT APPROXIMATELY 37% CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN LONG-RANGE PLANNING. ANALYSIS OF
THESE PLANS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE MORE OPERATIONS-ORIENTED THAN
STRATEGY-ORIENTED. MOST ARE PREPARED ON AN INFORMAL BASIS BY THE DIRECTORS AND
THEIR STAFFS WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A FORMAL PLANNING METHODOLOGY. A MAJORITY OF
THE LIBRARY DIRECTORS NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN PLANNING EXPRESS A NEED TO DO
SO IN THE FUTURE.
