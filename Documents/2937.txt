GOOD AMERICAN AND ENGLISH EXPERIENCE WITH ON-LINE SEARCHING.
     
EXAMINES SOME PUBLICATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
COMPUTER SEARCHING. DESCRIBES A 3 YEAR PROJECT (DIALIB) IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING
TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A LINKING AGENT TO COMMERCIAL
DATA BASES USING THE LOCKHEED DIALOG INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICE. THE
SERVICE WAS FREE FOR THE 1ST YEAR ONLY. USERS WERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND
RESEARCHERS, PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND LIBRARIANS. PROVIDES A CHECKLIST OF
POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN THE PLANNING PHASE. CONCLUDES THAT ON-LINE SERVICES
ARE A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE SERVICES. DESCRIBES ANOTHER PROJECT INVOLVING 4 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
ENGLAND. THE PLANNED ON-LINE SERVICE IN LANCASHIRE (BIROS) WAS TO BE A SERVICE
SEPARATE FROM THE MANUAL REFERENCE WORK. HERE TOO, STAFF WAS SPECIALLY TRAINED
AND THE PUBLIC, MAINLY FROM EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, SEEMED WILLING TO PAY
THE NECESSARY FEES. A SET OF ' GUIDELINES' WAS PREPARED. FINALLY, DISCUSSES
ATHERTON AND CHRISTIAN'S' 'LIBRARIANS AND ONLINE SERVICES', WHICH EXAMINES HOW
AND WHY LIBRARIES MAKE AUTOMATED SEARCH SYSTEMS AVAILABLE AND STRESSES THAT
THESE SYSTEMS CHANGE THE ROLE OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN QUALITATIVELY FROM
THAT OF AN ARCHIVIST TO THAT OF AN INFORMATION SPECIALIST.
