PROBLEMS WITH SOURCES OF INFORMATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS' THE
CASE OF THE WORLD-WIDE TREATY JUNGLE.

LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL GUIDANCE TO AND THROUGH THE
'TREATY JUNGLE' ENGENDERED BY THE DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
INTERESTS CAUSED BY THE RECENT DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT
NATION STATES. THE DEGREE OF ACCESSIBILITY TO TREATY INFORMATION IS MUCH
GREATER THAN BEFORE' TREATY INFORMATION IS NO LONGER THE PRESERVE OF
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THANKS TO PUBLICATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY
SERIES. THERE IS STILL A NEED, HOWEVER, FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CURRENTLY
PUBLISHED TREATY COLLECTIONS AND TREATIES IN FORCE. THE MANY PROBLEMS STILL
FACED IN GAINING ACCESS TO TREATY INFORMATION CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BY
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND BETTER SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY
SECTION.
