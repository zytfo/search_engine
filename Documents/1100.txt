CONCENTRATE ON THE CHILDREN'S AND JUVENILE LITERATURE IN IMMIGRANT LANGUAGES!.

THE BASIS OF A NORWEGIAN IMMIGRATION POLICY IS LAID DOWN IN PARLIAMENTARY
STATEMENTS NUMBERS 39 OF 1973-74 AND 74 OF 1979-80. THESE EMPHASISE THAT THERE
MUST BE EQUALITY FOR ALL TO PRACTISE RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL
ACTIVITIES. LIBRARIES MUST MAKE LITERATURE AND OTHER MEDIA AVAILABLE SO THAT
IMMIGRANTS CAN MAINTAIN THEIR CULTURAL LINKS WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY. BUT THEY
MUST ALSO MAKE MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHICH CAN FACILITATE THAT IMMIGRANTS'
ADAPTATION TO THE NEW COUNTRY AND ITS LANGUAGE AND GIVE THE MAJORITY
POPULATION INFORMATION ON THE IMMIGRANTS' BACKGROUND. THE DEICHMAN LIBRARY IN
OSLO BEGAN IN 1975 TO ACT AS A CENTRAL LIBRARY TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS REGARDS
IMMIGRANT LITERATURE. THE LIBRARY ALSO ISSUES DEPOSITS TO LIBRARIES. STRESSES
THE IMPORTANCE FOR CHILDREN OF COMPETENCE IN THE MOTHER TONGUE AND CALLS FOR A
NORDIC COOPERATION IN PRODUCTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN IMMIGRANT
LANGUAGES.
