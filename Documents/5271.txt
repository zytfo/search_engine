FORM OR FUNCTION? AN ANALYSIS OF THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT IN THE MODERN ACADEMIC
LIBRARY.

EXPLORES HOW SEPARATE SERIALS PROCEDURES FROM THE REST OF THE STOCK PROCESSING
DEVELOPED IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND WHETHER TODAY THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE
PROCEDURES IS POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE. CONCLUDES THAT THE ORGANISATION OF
PROCEDURES BY FUNCTION AND THE GROWING USE OF AUTOMATION CAN RESULT IN MORE
EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND BETTER SERVICE AND MAY ALSO LEAD TO THE DISSOLUTION
OF TECHNICAL SERVICES AS THEY ARE KNOWN TODAY AND TO A NEW DEFINITION OF
LIBRARY WORK WHEREBY WORK IS ORGANISED BY SUBJECT AND/OR SERVICE AND BY
FUNCTION WITHIN A SUBJECT, NOT BY FORMAT.
