PUBLIC MUSIC LIBRARIES-A STATISTICAL POINT OF VIEW.

AT THE END OF MAR 79 THE 79/80 RAPID STATISTICS CONCERNING PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY WERE PUBLISHED. THEY ARE PUBLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE GERMAN LIBRARY
INSTITUTE BUT FROM 1982 THE 'DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSSTATISTIK DBS' WILL BE
PUBLISHING A COMPLETE SET OF STATISTICS. THE SECTION CONCERNING PUBLIC MUSIC
LIBRARIES IN THE CURRENT STATISTICS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE 54 OF THEM AND THAT 2
MORE ARE PLANNED. THE STATISTICS CONCERNING STOCK ARE DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS
SOME LIBRARIES NOW HAVE NEW METHODS OF CALCULATING STOCK OR OTHERS HAVE THEIR
STOCK INCLUDED IN CENTRAL LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN STOCK OF ABOUT 2.9% AND THE RATE OF BORROWING
HAS RISEN BY 6.4%. OF THE 40 LIBRARIES WHICH SUPPLIED FIGURES CONCERNING
EXPENDITURE 1/3 HAD NO RISE IN THEIR BUDGET OR EVEN HAD CUTS OF BETWEEN -7%
AND -24%. ALTHOUGH THE REMAINING 2/3 HAD A BUDGET RISE THE TOTAL DROP IN
EXPENDITURE WAS 2.1%.
