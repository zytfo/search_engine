MARKS OF INSUFFICIENCY: LESSONS OF A MEETING AND OF A THEMATIC ISSUE OF A
JOURNAL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL MEETING HELD IN AUTUMN 81 IN KECSKEMET AND THE THEMATIC ISSUE
OF THE PERIODICAL INFORMACIO/ELEKTRONIKA (16 (5) 1981) DEALING WITH LIBRARY
MECHANISATION HAVE RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING HUNGARIAN
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION. THE PROBLEMS RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE
DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FROM THE DRAWING UP OF CATALOGUES FOLLOWING FROM
THEM. ON THE BASIS OF THEIR EXAMINATION, POINTS TO THE FACTS HINDERING
DEVELOPMENT' FOREIGN RESULTS OF AUTOMATION ARE TAKEN OVER WITH DIFFICULTY;
LIBRARY MECHANISATION IS UNCOORDINATED; THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION IS
UNDEVELOPED AND TERMINOLOGY IS NOT CLEAR.
