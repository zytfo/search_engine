DOES CURRENT AFFAIRS DOCUMENTATION INCREASE LIBRARY USE?.
     
IN MODERN SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS THROUGH LIBRARIES TO
INFORMATION ON ALL MATTERS AFFECTING THEIR LIVES. FOR THIS PURPOSE COLLECTIONS
OF MATERIAL RELATING TO MATTERS OF CURRENT, SOCIAL CONCERN SHOULD BE FORMED IN
LOCAL LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, MATERIAL OF THIS NATURE IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
AND TO ORGANISE. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH MATERIAL IS OFTEN
SHORT, THE LIBRARIAN MUST ENSURE THROUGH CAREFUL PUBLICITY THAT THE COLLECTION
IS USED AS HEAVILY AS POSSIBLE. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) PLANS TO
ORGANISE A MEETING IN 1982 FOR LIBRARIANS TO DISCUSS THE ORGANISATION AND
EXPLOITATION OF SUCH COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
