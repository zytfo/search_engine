THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A SOCIAL MILIEU.
     
IN DENMARK THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS THE CENTRE OF COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE,
SINCE THERE IS MORE EMPHASIS HERE THAN IN GERMANY ON THEATRICAL AND MUSICAL
ACTIVITIES. LIBRARIES ARE BUILT MAINLY FROM WOOD, SLATE AND GLASS, WITH A
STRUCTURE DESIGNED TO SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES; THEY ARE ALWAYS
SITUATED CENTRALLY WITHIN THEIR AREA. PUPPET THEATRES, TOYS, FACILITIES FOR
PAINTING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC AND EVEN LITTLE PUSH-CHAIRS FOR THE SMALLEST
CHILDREN ARE PROVIDED IN LIBRARIES WITH A LARGE PROPORTION OF CHILD READERS.
ALL LIBRARIES CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE ROOM FOR MEETINGS. BASIC STOCKS ALWAYS
CONTAIN GERMAN AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND TALKING BOOKS FOR THE OLD AND
PARTIALLY SIGHTED. BOOKS ARE TAKEN OUT TO THE HOUSEBOUND AND HANDICAPPED;
LIBRARIES EVEN SUPPLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS FOR USE IN PAEDIATRICIANS'
WAITING-ROOMS.
