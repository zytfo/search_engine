NEED FOR TELECOMMUNICATION STANDARDS FOR INTERCONNECTION WITH THE U.S. POSTAL
SERVICE EMSS (ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEM).

DESCRIBES THE EFFORT WHICH WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE TELECOMMUNICATION

ORGANISATIONS DESIRING TO INPUT MESSAGES INTO A FUTURE USPS EMSS VIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEANS CAN DO SO IF THE INTERCONNECTION STANDARDS ARE
SATISFIED.
