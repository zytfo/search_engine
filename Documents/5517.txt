ALA IN SAN FRANCISCO' COUNCILOR'S REPORT.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL SESSION AT THE ALA ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO,
1981, PRESENTING A PERSONAL VIEW OF COUNCIL'S 'OPERATING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALA
AND DIVISIONS', CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION. NEW BY-LAWS WHICH SET STUDENT DUES
IN DIVISIONS AT $5.00 AND AUTHORISE DIVISIONS TO SET UP NATIONAL CONFERENCES
GENERATED STRONG SUPPORT. THIS LATTER DECISION REFLECTS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
JOINING DIVISIONS AND ROUND TABLES OF PERIPHERAL INTEREST, AND ITS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL CONFERENCES WILL HURT STATE
CONFERENCES IN TERMS OF ATTENDANCE AND EXHIBITORS.
