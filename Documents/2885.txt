TECHNIQUES OF CLASSIFICATION IN PSYCHOLOGY I' FACTOR ANALYSIS, FACET ANALYSES,
MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING, LATENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS.
     
CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS ARE QUITE COMMON IN PSYCHOLOGY, AND MANY
CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO THIS SCIENCE. THE
MOST COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUE IN PSYCHOLOGY IS FACTOR ANALYSIS. DESCRIBES THE
UNDERLYING MODEL OF FACTOR ANALYSIS, ITS INDETERMINACY PROBLEMS, MODIFICATIONS
AND EXTENSIONS. ALSO DISCUSSES FACET ANALYSIS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
(MDS), WHICH CAN BE USED EITHER AS A PRELIMINARY STAGE FOR OTHER
CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES OR AS A CLASSIFICATION METHOD ITSELF. A DISTINCTION
IS MADE BETWEEN METRIC AND NON-METRIC MDS PROCEDURES, AND BETWEEN METHODS FOR
PROXIMITY DATA, DOMINANCE DATA, PROFILE DATA, AND CONJOINT MEASUREMENT DATA.
FINALLY THE MODELS AND APPLICATIONS OF LATENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS ARE
DISCUSSED.
