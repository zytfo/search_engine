PERIODICALS FOR THE DISABLED' THEIR IMPORTANCE AS INFORMATION SOURCES.

RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION MANDATES INTEGRATION OF DISABLED AMERICANS INTO THE
MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
PHYSICALLY DISABLED. LIBRARIANS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS MUST GAIN AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSPECTIVES AND CONCERNS OF DISABLED PEOPLE, AND THIS IS
BEST GAINED FROM PERSONAL CONTACT. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, READING OF THE
PERIODICAL LITERATURE PUBLISHED FOR AND BY THE DISABLED IS RECOMMENDED. THESE
PERIODICALS HAVE CHANGED AS THE INFORMATION DEMANDS OF THE DISABLED HAVE
EVOLVED, AND THEY OFFER INFORMATION NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE. THEY CAN EDUCATE
LIBRARIANS, REHABILITATION WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEEDS AND
ABILITIES OF THE DISABLED IN THE USA.
