THE WRITTEN WORD AND THE DOCUMENT' CONTRADICTORY AND COMPLEMENTARY DIALECTICS.

TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. USING A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK DERIVED
FROM RECENT FRENCH RESEARCH IN BIBLIOLOGY AND DOCUMENTOLOGY, THE DIALECTICS OF
THE WRITTEN WORD AND THE DOCUMENT ARE ANALYSED SEQUENTIALLY, BY COMPARING AND
CONTRASTING THE PROPERTIES OF EACH IN RELATION TO THEIR ESSENTIAL
CHARACTERISTICS; HOW THEY FUNCTION WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNICATION
CIRCUITS; MARXIST SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY; AND THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM
THIS STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE 2 ENTITIES A SCIENTIFIC SYNTHESIS IS EFFECTED
DELIMITING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIBLIOLOGY AND DOCUMENTOLOGY, AND THE
APPLICATIONS OF THIS THEORY IN THE TEACHING FIELD EXAMINED. THE ANALYTICAL
MODEL EMPLOYED, AND ITS METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION, IS ADVANCED AS A WORKING
HYPOTHESIS FOR FURTHER CRITICISM, RESEARCH, AND MODIFICATION.
