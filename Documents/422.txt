RELATING MUTAGENICITY TO CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.

A COMPUTER PROGRAM CORRELATING CHEMICAL STRUCTURE WITH MUTAGENESIS ACTIVITY
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A PREDICTIVE TEST FOR HAZARD EVALUATION. SETS OF
SUBSTRUCTURAL UNITS ARE DERIVED FROM COMPLETE STRUCTURES, AND THE PROBABILITY
THAT A STRUCTURE CONTAINING A GIVEN UNIT WILL HAVE A DESIGNATED CATEGORY OF
ACTIVITY IS CALCULATED. THE PROGRAM, VALIDATED BY BACTERIAL MUTAGENESIS
TESTING, IS CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING SIMILAR STRUCTURES, SHOWING WHY THEY ARE
SIMILAR, AND ESTIMATING THE ACTIVITY OF A STRUCTURE.
