INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION ON A SCIENTIST'S
INFORMATION PRODUCTIVITY.
     
THE INFORMATION PRODUCTIVITY OF A SCIENTIST DEPENDS UPON THE NUMBER AND
FREQUENCY OF CONTACTS WITH COLLEAGUES AND TIME SPENT ON SUCH CONTACTS. MORE
OFTEN, A SCIENTIST ESTABLISHES CONTACTS WITH THOSE WHO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO
THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE. THE PROBABILITY OF CONTACTS DECREASES
WITH INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN SCIENTISTS. SUGGESTS USING SUCH CONTACTS TO
IMPROVE INFORMATION SERVICES TO THE SCIENTISTS.
