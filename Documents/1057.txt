SOCIALIST LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE GDR.

SUMMARY OF A THESIS PRESENTED TO THE SITTARD SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
STUDIES IN 1980. EAST GERMANY HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED NETWORK OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. IN EACH OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 REGIONS CENTRAL LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN
DESIGNATED TO ACT AS REGIONAL SUPPORT CENTRES FOR THE SMALLER DISTRICT AND
LOCAL COMMUNITY LIBRARIES. LIBRARY SERVICES ARE GOVERNED BY THE STATE LIBRARY
ACT OF 1968 AND ALL LIBRARIES ARE MEMBERS OF THE EAST GERMAN UNION OF
LIBRARIES. IN CONTRAST TO LIBRARIES IN WESTERN EUROPE LIBRARIES IN EAST
GERMANY HAVE A STRONG POLITICAL CHARACTER AND ARE COMPELLED BY LAW TO SUPPORT
THE SOCIALIST ECONOMIC SYSTEM. ALL LIBRARIES ARE RUN BY A LIBRARY COUNCIL WITH
REPRESENTATIVES DRAWN FROM USERS, LOCAL ORGANISATIONS AND OTHER LIBRARIES.
