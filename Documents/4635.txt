FACULTY PAPERS AND SPECIAL-SUBJECT REPOSITORIES.
     
THE GROWTH OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES AND THE PROLIFERATION OF
REPOSITORIES COLLECTING DOCUMENTS ON SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, HAVE CREATED A COMPLEX

FACULTY MEMBERS. HENCE PAPERS BY FACULTY MEMBERS WORKING IN FIELDS FOR WHICH
SPECIAL-SUBJECT ARCHIVES EXIST MAY BE SOUGHT BY 2 OR MORE COMPETING
INSTITUTIONS. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH SPECIAL-SUBJECT ARCHIVES CAN COOPERATE
AND WORK TOWARDS WAYS OF SOLVING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS.
