NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY SYSTEMS. DESCRIBES 4 BASIC MODELS OF NATIONAL
INTERLENDING SYSTEMS' MODEL A IS ONE OF TOTAL CENTRALISATION ON 1 SOURCE;
MODEL B CONCENTRATES PROVISION ON 2 OR 3 LIBRARIES; MODEL C CONCENTRATES
SUPPLY ON A GREATER NUMBER OF LIBRARIES, SPECIALLY DESIGNATED AND FUNDED FOR
THE PURPOSE; AND MODEL D, WHICH EXISTS IN MOST COUNTRIES, IS 1 OF TOTAL
DECENTRALISATION. LOOKS AT COMBINATIONS OF THESE MODELS, THE ECONOMICS OF
CENTRALISATION, CENTRALISED 2VERSUS1 COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS AND EFFECT OF
TECHNOLOGY.
