THE APPLICABILITY OF AUDIOVISUAL AIDS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND TRAINING IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

READING ABILITY IS THE RESULT OF A PROLONGED FORMAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS
REQUIRING PRACTICE, EXPERIENCE AND ACCESS TO PRINT MATERIALS. IT APPEARS
OBVIOUS THAT AUDIOVISUALS WOULD GREATLY AID COMMUNICATION, PARTICULARLY IN
COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF PRINT ILLITERACY OR SEMI-LITERACY,
AND THERE IS A WIDELY HELD ASSUMPTION THAT PICTURES ARE A FORM OF
TRANSCULTURAL LANGUAGE WHICH EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS AND CAN INTERPRET. DISCUSSES
PICTORIAL LITERACY, APPLICABILITY OF AUDIOVISUALS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
FORMS OF VISUALS AND THE VALUE OF THEIR CORRECT DESIGN, VALUES OF AUDIOVISUALS
PRODUCED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, STANDARDS OF PRODUCTION AND CHOICE OF
FORMAT, AND APPROPRIATE AUDIOVISUAL FORMATS.
