ALIEN IN THE READING ROOM.

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS REPLACING ITS CARD CATALOGUE WITH A COMPUTERISED
CATALOGUE. DESCRIBES THE REACTIONS OF A REFERENCE LIBRARIAN WHEN A TERMINAL
WAS INSTALLED IN THE READING ROOM. SEARCHING WAS SPEEDED UP, WITH THE
POSSIBILITY OF LIMITING SEARCHES TO CERTAIN DATES, LANGUAGES OR PLACES OF
ORIGIN. DISCUSSES THE COMPONENT WORD SYSTEM WHICH RESPONDS TO A COMMAND TO
FIND WORDS ANYWHERE IN THE TITLE, SUBJECT HEADINGS, AUTHOR'S NAME, SERIES, OR
NOTES ON A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRY, THUS ENABLING LIBRARIANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF INCOMPLETE CITATIONS. IN MAY 77 A COMPUTER CATALOGUE CENTRE WAS ESTABLISHED
FOR THE PUBLIC NEAR THE MAIN CATALOGUE, WHICH HAS PROVED EXTREMELY POPULAR. A
USER SURVEY SHOWED THAT COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION IS NEEDED. FUTURE PLANS
ARE OUTLINED.
