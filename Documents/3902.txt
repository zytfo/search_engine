MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.
     
THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BASES AND DATA BANK SUPPLIERS HAS BROUGHT WITH
IT THE PROBLEM THAT DIFFERENT HOST COMPUTERS MUST NORMALLY BE ACCESSED USING
DIFFERENT COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONE
ANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO,
THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2 SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENT
IMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORE
CONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET,
BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES,
AND ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN A DATA BASE IS OFFERED BY SEVERAL
SUPPLIERS.
