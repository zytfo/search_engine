CATALOGUE ENTRIES FOR ITEMS IN COLLECTIONS PUBLISHED IN MICROFORM.

THE PROBLEM OF MAKING KNOWN TO LIBRARY USERS THE CONTENTS OF COLLECTIONS OF
MATERIALS PUBLISHED IN MICROFORM ARE DISCUSSED. WAYS OF OVERCOMING THE PROBLEM
ARE OUTLINED, SUCH AS THE USE OF PUBLISHED GUIDES TO MICROFORM COLLECTIONS,
ADDED ENTRIES TO CARD CATALOGUES, AND ANALYTICAL CATALOGUE ENTRIES FOR
COLLECTIONS. THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EACH METHOD ARE GIVEN. THE
VARIOUS ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE UK TO OVERCOME
THE PROBLEM ARE OUTLINED. A SIGNIFICANT MOVE TOWARDS UNIVERSALLY USEFUL
ENTRIES IS THE ADOPTION OF AACR2 FOR VARIOUS NATIONAL AUTOMATED DATA BASES.
IDEALLY, THERE SHOULD NOW BE COOPERATION WITH PUBLISHERS FOR
CATALOGUING-IN-SOURCE FOR MICROFORM PUBLICATIONS.
