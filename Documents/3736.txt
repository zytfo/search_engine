LIBRARIES' ROLE IN INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
WHILE ALL THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO AID FOR DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES DEVOTED TO INFORMATION SERVICES ARE
COMPARATIVELY SMALL. THE 14TH SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARY CONFERENCE IS URGED TO TAKE
UP THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN INFORMATION FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH IS NOT
MERELY A QUESTION OF STATISTICAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DOCUMENTATION, BUT COVERS
ALL FORMS OF LITERARY AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSION. SOME SWEDISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES
HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED FACILITIES FOR DISCUSSING CURRENT TOPICS IN THE FIELD,
IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL STUDY GROUPS AND SIDA, THE SWEDISH ORGANISATION FOR
INTERNATIONAL AID. A SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS WAS HELD IN SUMMER 77 ON KENYA AND
TANZANIA, AND A UNESCO SEMINAR IS PRODUCING A HANDBOOK OF PRACTICAL HINTS FOR
LIBRARIANS ON INFORMATION REGARDING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. A PILOT PROJECT ON
BORAS HAS BEEN GRANTED FINANCE TO STOCK A SPECIAL 'CORNER' OF DEVELOPING
COUNTRY INFORMATION, AND HOPES T O MAN IT CONTINUOUSLY FOR ENQUIRERS.
