ORGANIZATION OF SERIALS WORK FOR MANUAL AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS.

IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CONVINCING RATIONALE OR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF GROUPING SERIALS ACTIVITIES FOR COORDINATION, LIBRARIANS
FIND IT HARD TO CHOOSE AMONG DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES FOR SERIALS

THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE GROUPING OF SERIALS ACTIVITIES. DESCRIBES A
SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE TO SERIALS MANAGEMENT IN A UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY. AN APPRAISAL OF THE EXPECTED ORGANISATIONAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION
LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A STRUCTURE BASED ON THIS PRINCIPLE WILL BE
EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE FOR AUTOMATION AS FOR MANUAL OPERATION.
