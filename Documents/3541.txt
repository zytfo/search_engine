BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND SCIENCE: THE IMAGE OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN IN
CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSION.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 10TH ADVANCED TRAINING SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS AT THE
HERZOG AUGUST LIBRARY IN WOLFENBUTTEL, FEB 81. FOR YEARS LIBRARIANS HAVE
ARGUED OVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PURE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION IN
THEIR WORK, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN ALLOTTING TASKS TO THE
HIGHEST STAFF GRADES. LIBRARIANS FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE INADEQUATELY
REPRESENTED WHEN QUESTIONS ON UNIVERSITY STAFFING ARISE AND SHOULD STRIVE FOR
BETTER COORDINATION. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PART OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND CLOSE LINKS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS DISCIPLINE AND
THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN. ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DUTIES FOR THE HIGHEST
STAFF GRADES, ESPECIALLY FOR HEADS OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS, MUST BE CLEARLY
DEFINED.
