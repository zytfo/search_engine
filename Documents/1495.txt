X-RAY' USA O-UK 1.

IN THE 85 YEARS SINCE X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS WERE FIRST PRODUCED, THE WORLD HAS
BEEN LITTERED WITH MILLIONS OF X-RAY SHEETS. PROFILE MICROFILM (KENT) LTD. HAS
STARTED TO PRODUCE MICROFILM OF X-RAY PLATES. THE TASK IS NOT EASY, AS THE
DENSITY OF THE ORIGINAL X-RAY PLATE IS DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. AFTER 15 YEARS
OF SPORADIC MICROFILMING OF X-RAYS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, PROFILE MICROFILM
LTD. HAS ACHIEVED THE RIGHT COMBINATION BETWEEN THE FILM EMULSION AND THE
CHEMICALS. THE SPECIAL X-RAY CAMERA USED MAY ALSO BE USED IN LIBRARIES AND
ELSEWHERE; IT OFFERS IMPROVED RESOLUTION AND AN AUTOMATIC EXPOSURE CONTROL
SYSTEM WITH PROJECTABLE PHOTOCELL, AND A VARIABLE HEIGHT BOOK COPIER TABLE.
