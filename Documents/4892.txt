REVISING THE DEWEY MUSIC SCHEDULES' TRADITION VS. INNOVATION.
     
PRESENTS A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE MUSIC SCHEDULES OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL FOR A TOTAL REVISION OF
THESE SCHEDULES. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE ABILITY OF EACH CLASSIFICATION
TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARY PATRONS USING THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT TO RETRIEVE
SCORES FOR PERFORMANCE PURPOSES. THE BASIS OF THE COMPARISON PRESENTED HERE IS
A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 400 CHAMBER-MUSIC SCORES CHOSEN FROM THE 2BRITISH CATALOGUE
OF MUSIC1. EACH CLASSIFICATION IS ANALYSED FOR ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN
TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PERFORMERS, AND THE CLASSIFICATIONS
ARE THEN COMPARED USING STANDARD STATISTICAL METHODS. CONCLUDES WITH A
DISCUSSION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL IS A PROPER
VEHICLE FOR A PHOENIX TREATMENT OF DDC 780 AND SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF
INCLUDING IT IN SOME FUTURE EDITION OF DDC.
