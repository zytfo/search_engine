AUTOMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTY
ESTIMATION.

AUTOMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATION OF
HEATS OF VAPORISATION. COMPUTER-READABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURES WERE ANALYSED ALGORITHMICALLY TO DERIVE STRUCTURAL GROUPINGS TO BE
USED IN THE MODEL. THESE WERE THEN INPUT AS VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION
ANALYSES, WHICH GAVE THE GROUP CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE USED IN ESTIMATION. THE
METHOD GAVE GOOD ESTIMATIONS FOR VARIOUS STRUCTURAL TYPES AND COULD BE APPLIED
TO A VARIETY OF THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES.
