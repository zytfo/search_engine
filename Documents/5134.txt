LAW CONCERNING THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARY
STATISTICS.

IN 1971 THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC DECREED BY
LAW THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION. ITS
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED HERE, MAINLY IN REGARD TO LIBRARY
STATISTICS PROVIDED WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT
STATE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STATISTICS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1979; IT
SHOWED MANY SHORTCOMINGS CONCERNING STATISTICAL INDEXES AND THEIR DEFINITION.
AS A RESULT A UNIFIED STATISTICAL SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED WHICH IS HERE
DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.
