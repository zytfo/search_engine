COMPUTER-ASSISTED MECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. 2. PERCEPTION
OF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS.
     
NEW ALGORITHMS FOR THE PERCEPTION OF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS WERE
DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAMEO PROGRAM FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED
MECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. A NOTEWORTHY ASPECT OF THE RING
ALGORITHM IS THAT ONLY RINGS BELONGING TO THE SMALLEST SET OF SMALLEST RINGS
ARE FOUND. RESULTS FOR REPRESENTATIVE MOLECULES ARE PRESENTED, AND RULES FOR
DETERMINING THE AROMATICITY/TAUTOMER STATUS OF RINGS, ESPECIALLY HETEROCYCLES,
ARE DISCUSSED.
