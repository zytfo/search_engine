GONE FICHE-ING..
     
MICROFICHE PROJECTION HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SLIDE OR
OVERHEAD PROJECTORS BY A SUCCESSION OF HARDWARE PRODUCERS. IT IS A VERY
ATTRACTIVE IDEA, BUT THERE ARE DRAWBACKS, INCLUDING AMBIENT LIGHT, THE NEED TO
USE THE FICHE IN ORDER WITH NO DODGING ABOUT BACK AND FORTH, AND THE INABILITY
OF THE PRESENTER TO DRAW OR WRITE ON THE FICHE.
