ANDERSON: THE RELUCTANT LIBRARIAN.
     
ANDERSON'S 'RELUCTANCE' STEMS FROM HIS TRANSFER FROM THE NEW SOUTH WALES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO THE HEADSHIP OF THE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY, SYDNEY,
DURING THE AGRICULTURAL RECESSION IN 1893. DESPITE HIS LACK OF PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD, ANDERSON MADE HIS MARK AS AN ADMINISTRATOR, IN THE
TECHNIQUES OF LIBRARIANSHIP, AND IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT. THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA'S H.C.L. ANDERSON AWARD IS CONFERRED FOR 'OUTSTANDING
SERVICE TO LIBRARIANSHIP OR TO THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN AUSTRALIA'.
