UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS AS SEEKERS OF INFORMATION' SOURCES OF REFERENCES TO
BOOKS AND THEIR FIRST USE VERSUS DATE OF PUBLICATION.

QUESTIONING OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND PURE SCIENTISTS/TECHNOLOGISTS REVEALED

BOOK'S INTEREST POTENTIAL DEPENDS UPON SEVERAL PARAMETERS' (1) USER COMMUNITY

DEPENDENT ON SOURCE AGE.
