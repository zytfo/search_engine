DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME AT
THE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11 OCT 80. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVE
NO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUP
UNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ON
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONS
HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUT
THE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.
