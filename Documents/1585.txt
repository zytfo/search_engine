MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AT A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED TO STUDY VOLUME OF USE,
USER ACTIVITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF ITEMS SOUGHT BY USERS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
STRATIFIED SAMPLING METHODS EMPLOYED TO MEASURE VOLUME OF USE AND USER
ACTIVITY SHOWED THAT THIS MEDIUM-SIZED PUBLIC LIBRARY PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY
4,000 USER SERVICE HOURS PER WEEK. THE AVERAGE VISIT LASTED 34 MINUTES WITH
32% OF ALL VISIT TIME SPENT READING LIBRARY MATERIALS. OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF
ITEMS SOUGHT BY USERS IN THE ADULT SECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 38%. THE
APPLICATION OF THESE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY
RELATIVELY UNTRAINED STAFF OR VOLUNTEERS, TO PINPOINT POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN
LIBRARY SERVICE IS DISCUSSED.
