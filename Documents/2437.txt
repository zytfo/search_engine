THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EXPERIENCES OF 4 LOCAL EDUCATORS WHO SERVED AS
INFORMATION CONSULTANTS LINKING THEIR CLIENTS WITH ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SERVICES. 4 EDUCATORS IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND SETTINGS, BUT IN

CLIENTS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER FOR ONTARIO (EISO), A
CENTRALISED, ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RETRIEVAL SERVICE. A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED
