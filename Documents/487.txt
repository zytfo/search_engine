TOWARDS A CANADIAN POLICY ON INTELLECTUAL OWNERSHIP.

EXAMINES THE QUESTION OF AUTHORS' FAIR REMUNERATION FOR USE OF THEIR WORK WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE CANADIAN SITUATION. ARGUES THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT
MOST FROM THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL WORKS ARE DATA BASE
PRODUCERS, HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ENTERPRISES, AND INFORMATION NETWORKS. THE
ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ARE EXPLORED TO ESTABLISH THE
PRINCIPLES BEHIND PROTECTING AUTHORS' INTERESTS. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE APPLIED
TO THE OPERATIONS OF THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF ACTUAL
EXPLOITATION ASSESSED BY EXAMINING THE NUMBER OF REFERENCES FREELY AVAILABLE
THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE CANADIAN INFORMATION NETWORK. CONCLUDES BY STATING THE
NECESSITY FOR A NATIONAL POLICY ENSURING THAT AUTHORS SHARE IN THE PROFITS OF
INFORMATION NETWORKS.
