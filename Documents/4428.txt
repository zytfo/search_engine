LIBRARY SCIENCE AND HISTORY' A DIALECTICAL APPROACH.
     
CRITICISES CONVENTIONAL STUDIES OF LIBRARY HISTORY FOR FAILING TO APPRECIATE
THAT LIBRARIES ARE ESSENTIALLY PART OF AN INTERLOCKING COMPLEX OF INSTITUTIONS
FORMING A PARTICULAR SOCIAL STRUCTURE, WHICH ITSELF IS DETERMINED BY THE
HISTORICAL PROCESS. SHOWS HOW DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM CAN BE USED TO DEAL WITH
SOCIAL ENTITIES AS PART OF A TOTALITY OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FACTORS, AND
EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY OF VIEWING HISTORY AS A PROCESS AND NOT AS FINITE.
ONCE THIS IS UNDERSTOOD, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO PLACE THE STUDY OF LIBRARIES
ON A RECOGNISABLE SCIENTIFIC BASIS, AS A COMPLEX OF PRACTICES WHICH ARE
ULTIMATELY SOCIALLY DETERMINED.
