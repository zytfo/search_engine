SELLING TO SURVIVE.

EDITED AND ABRIDGED VERSION OF A TALK GIVEN AT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR
SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, TRAIN ITS STAFF TO BE
SALESPEOPLE, AND WORK ON PERSONAL COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.
