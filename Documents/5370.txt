A MODEL FOR A WEIGHTED RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

RECENT ARTICLES HAVE ANALYSED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH CONTINUOUS WEIGHTS OF
VARIOUS TYPES AND/OR WITH A BOOLEAN STRUCTURE FOR THE QUERIES. THEY HAVE ALSO
SUGGESTED CRITERIA WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS OUGHT TO SATISFY AND RECORD EVALUATION
MECHANISMS WHICH PARTIALLY SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. OFFERS A MORE CAREFUL
ANALYSIS, BASED ON A GENERALISATION OF THE DISCRETE WEIGHTS. ALSO LOOKS AT THE
WEIGHTS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INVOLVING THRESHOLDS, AND
GENERATES AN IMPROVED EVALUATION MECHANISM WHICH SEEMS TO FULFIL A LARGER
SUBSET OF THE DESIRED CRITERIA THAN PREVIOUS MECHANISMS. THIS NEW MECHANISM
ALLOWS THE USER TO ATTACH A 'THRESHOLD' TO THE QUERY TERM.
