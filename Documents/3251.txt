TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIBRARY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
OUTLINES AN APPROACH, WITH BOTH WIDESPREAD IMPLICATIONS AND SPECIFIC PRACTICAL
STEPS, FOR ASSEMBLING SOME OF THE DATA THAT LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS NOW REQUIRE
IN ORDER TO MAKE LIBRARIES OPERATE MORE EFFECTIVELY. THESE DATA HAVE NOT BEEN
ASSEMBLED IN THE PAST BECAUSE THE COSTS IN STAFF TIME ALONE HAVE BEEN AND
CONTINUE TO BE PROHIBITIVE FOR MOST INSTITUTIONS. ONE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO
EFFECTIVE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM. SOME INVESTIGATORS IN THIS AREA SEEM TO HAVE BECOME
FASCINATED WITH THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF VARIOUS ELUSIVE AND FUGITIVE LIBRARY
STATISTICAL MEASURES, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE OPERATIONAL
SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ASSEMBLE THESE DATA. THE PROPOSAL OUTLINED
HERE STRESSES THE NEED FOR A TOTAL SYSTEMS APPROACH, BASED UPON STANDARDISED
TERMINOLOGY; MACHINE-AIDED DATA COLLECTION, AND CUSTOMISED COMPUTER PROCESSING
AND REPORTING AS WE LL AS SYSTEMATIC TRAINING AND DOCUMENTATION.
