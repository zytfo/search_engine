VENETO' TOWARDS A POLICY LINE FOR LIBRARIES.
     
AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS BESETTING THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF
LIBRARY SERVICES IN A NORTH ITALIAN REGION, IN RELATION TO INDEPENDENT
PROPOSALS FOR A TOTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE SYSTEM. THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL
ROLES OF EACH COMPONENT ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL' THE STATE AND ITS
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK; THE REGION AND THE NEED FOR
LEGAL INTERVENTION TO CREATE A BASIS FOR AN EFFECTIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM; CELBIV,
THE REGIONAL PUBLISHERS' COOPERATIVE SERVING PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
THE NEED TO CAPITALISE ON THE RESOURCES IT OFFERS; THE PROVINCE AND THE
ORGANISATION OF COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES; AND THE TOWN, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO PROJECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN VENICE. AN APPENDIX CONTAINS THE RECENT
PROPOSALS FROM CELBIV TO ESTABLISH A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICE TO PUBLIC AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES, COVERING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ONLY, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE
CATALOGUING SERVICES AND AN INFORMATION CENTRE.
