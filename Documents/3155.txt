PROGRESS IN THE THEORY OF LIBRARY COORDINATION AND COOPERATION IN SCANDINAVIAN
COUNTRIES.
     
THE BEGINNING OF COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN SCANDINAVIA IN THE SPHERE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INFORMATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE THEORETICAL
STUDIES OF THE 1950S. IT WAS THEN THAT THE SCANDIA-PLAN, AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL
PLAN OF COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS OF FOREIGN LITERATURE, WAS STARTED. RESEARCH
INTO COOPERATION HAS DEVELOPED ALONG 3 MAIN LEVELS-NATIONAL, SCANDINAVIAN AND
INTERNATIONAL-AND THIS APPROACH IS REFLECTED IN THE RESEARCH METHODS EMPLOYED.
MATHEMATICAL METHODS ARE USED IN SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES AND STATISTICAL
MATHEMATICS ARE THE NORM ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE SCANDINAVIAN SUCCESS
IN LIBRARY COOPERATION DESERVES GREATER ATTENTION ON THE PART OF SOVIET
LIBRARIANS.
