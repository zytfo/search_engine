WILL THE STATE TAKE THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY ACT?.
     
STATE GRANTS TO THE VEST-AGDER (NORWAY) COUNTY LIBRARY AMOUNTED IN 1980 TO 35%
OF ITS BUDGET. RECENT PROPOSALS BY THE JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT
REFORM WOULD MEAN THE WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUPPORT. IF RESPONSIBILITY FOR
LIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARY
DUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THE
REVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971 DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARY
SERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THE
INFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971 ACT WAS THE
LONG-STANDING REGIONAL IMBALANCE IN SCHOOL LIBRARY AND PUBLIC LIBRARY
STANDARDS. UNDER THE NEW PROPOSALS, LIBRARIES IN THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS WOULD
BE IN MOST DANGER, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITY AS A WHOLE WOULD BE VULNERABLE TO
POLITICAL MOTIVATION.
