BETWEEN GIN AND TWIN' MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD.

AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THE UN CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GLOBAL INFORMATION NETWORK (GIN).
HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE INDUSTRIALISED
COUNTRIES AND ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, GIN IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A PAPER
AGREEMENT. EVEN IF IT WERE ESTABLISHED, IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO FULFIL THE REAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD. A BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WOULD BE TO SHARE LOCALLY PRODUCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INFORMATION AMONGST THEMSELVES AND DEVELOP TWIN (A THIRD WORLD INFORMATION
NETWORK) TO MEET THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT SUCH A SYSTEM IS RANDOMLY EVOLVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
