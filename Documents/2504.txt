ONLINE MICROFILM RECORDERS AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY.
     
THE LOS ALAMOS COMPUTING DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A SATELLITE GRAPHICS OUTPUT
STATION (PAGES). THIS STATION ACCEPTS USER REQUESTS FOR OUTPUT THROUGH A LARGE
COMPUTER NETWORK (THE ICN). THE SYSTEM TRANSLATES A STANDARD METAFILE INTO A
DEVICE-SPECIFIC FORMAT AND EFFICIENTLY GENERATES THE REQUESTED OUTPUT. AT THE
SAME TIME, PAGES PROVIDES SOME GRAPHICS PROCESSING, PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY THE
LARGE SUPERCOMPUTERS.
