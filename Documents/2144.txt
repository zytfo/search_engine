SELECTED RESULTS FROM A STUDY OF ASTRONOMY DOCUMENT FLOW, WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE 2ASTRONOMIYA1 ABSTRACTING SERIAL.
     
THE SERIALS AND PERIODICALS COVERED BY THE SOVIET ABSTRACTING JOURNAL
2ASTRONOMIYA1 IN 1973 ARE RANKED BY PRODUCTIVITY AND THE DISTRIBUTION OBTAINED
IS SHOWN TO BE DESCRIBED BY KENDALL'S FORMULATION OF THE ZIPF-BRADFORD LAW.
CORE AND NEAR-CORE TITLES ARE IDENTIFIED. TITLES IDENTIFIED AS BEING TOTALLY
ASTRONOMY-ORIENTED ACCOUNT FOR 25% OF THE TITLES COVERED. DISTRIBUTION OF
PUBLICATIONS BY LANGUAGE AND COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS ALSO ANALYSED. EMPHASISES
THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMPT ABSTRACTING OF PUBLICATIONS AND PROPOSES A
QUANTITATIVE CRITERION TO MEASURE THE SPEED WITH WHICH ABSTRACTS ARE
PUBLISHED. CONCLUDES THAT DOCUMENT FLOW IN ASTRONOMY IS TYPICAL OF THAT OF
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCES.
