THE OVERRATED PLB-A FIASCO TO FIX.
     
THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BINDING (PLB), ADVOCATED FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN THE
EARLY 1950S BY THE ALA ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN (THEN
CHILDREN'S SERVICES DIVISION), HAS BEEN A FIASCO. PLBS VARY IN QUALITY AND
SOME LAST NO MORE THAN A FEW CIRCULATIONS. IT IS ESPECIALLY FOOLISH FOR LARGE
LIBRARIES TO BUY ANY PLB THEY DO NOT NEED BECAUSE THEIR 38-40% TRADE DISCOUNTS
MAKE THEM BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE INEQUITABLE PLB NET PRICING SYSTEMS. REVIEWS
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY PLB AND CONTENDS THAT BINDING STANDARDS MUST BE SET
WHICH CATER FOR BOOKS LESS DURABLE THAN LBI CLASS 'A' STANDARDS AND WHICH
NULLIFY THE OBFUSCATING PRICING SCHEMES.
