ALGORITHMIC GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS INDEX NAMES. 1. GENERAL DESIGN.
     
THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) CHEMICAL REGISTRY SYSTEM IS A
COMPUTER-BASED CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES CHEMICAL
SUBSTANCES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. AN ALGORITHM HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED FOR COMPUTER GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS (CA) INDEX NAMES FOR
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM REGISTRY STRUCTURE RECORDS. WHEN PROGRAMMED AND
INSTALLED IN THE CAS PRODUCTION SYSTEM, THE ALGORITHM WILL SUPPORT CA INDEX
PREPARATION BY GENERATING NAMES FOR A MAJORITY OF THE APPROXIMATELY 1400 NEW
STRUCTURES PROCESSED PER WORKING DAY AT CAS.
