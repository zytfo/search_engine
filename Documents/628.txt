LIBRARIES AT THE CROSSROADS: A PERSPECTIVE ON LIBRARIES AND CULTURE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. ANALYSES
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULAR CULTURE AND FORMAL EDUCATION, AND ANTICIPATES
THE GROWTH OF THE FORMER WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE LATTER. THE
WELL-ROUNDED AND PROPERLY-FILLED LIBRARY SHOULD BE A PLACE FOR ALL CITIZENS,
AND PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR PEOPLE TO HANDLE NOT ONLY THE LANGUAGES OF SEEING,
BUT ALSO OF HEARING AND FEELING. THE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS OF PROVIDING SUCH
INFORMATION BEG THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTIRE LIBRARY COMMUNITY.
