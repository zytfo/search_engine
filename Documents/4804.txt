SDI IN AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY.
     
A 6-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL SDI SERVICE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NATAL
LIBRARY, PIETERMARITZBURG SOUTH AFRICA, AS PART OF A PLAN TO MAKE SUBJECT
LIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIME
FOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21 LECTURERS
FROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27 PROFILES. REFERENCES WERE
SUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THE
LIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6 MONTHS, FEEDBACK
REVEALED THAT 93% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLY
RELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERE
THE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF A
CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINOR
IMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOB
SATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. IN
TERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THE
EXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY
RELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPED
SUBJECT LIBRARIAN STRUCTURE. ITS SUCCESS, HOWEVER, DEPENDED ON AN ACTIVE
CAMPAIGN BY LIBRARIANS DIRECTED AT POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS.
