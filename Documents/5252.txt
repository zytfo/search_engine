A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE SERVICE TO READERS AS PART OF READING GUIDANCE.

SETS OUT TO DESCRIBE THE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE
WORK, MAKING CLEAR THOSE FEATURES WHICH, BY WAY OF THEIR ACTIVE PROMOTION OF
INFORMATION, DISTINGUISH IT FROM A PURELY PASSIVE QUESTION AND ANSWER FORM OF
SERVICE. THE ROLE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF
READING GUIDANCE IS SO IMPORTANT THAT RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE UNDERTAKEN INTO NOT
ONLY ITS ORGANISATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS, BUT ALSO ITS CONTENT. ONLY
WHEN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL METHODS ARE EMPLOYED IN ALL PROCESSES OF LIBRARY WORK
WILL A HIGHER LEVEL OF BOOK PROMOTION BE ACHIEVED.
