HAMBURG PUBLIC LIBRARIES-DRAFT DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

THE 10 YEAR PLAN, PUBLISHED IN OCT 81, CONCENTRATES ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND
LOOKS AT LIBRARY PROVISION IN THE CITY IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVER-INCREASING
OUTPUT OF BOOKS AND NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND OF HAMBURG'S GROWING IMMIGRANT
POPULATION. DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH DEMAND,
PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIAL CATEGORIES (E.G. HANDICAPPED PEOPLE). WAYS OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES NEEDS REAPPRAISAL. THE ROLE OF THE BRANCH LIBRARY
IN MEETING THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MUST BE EXAMINED AND
BETTER ACCOMMODATION IS NEEDED IF THE SERVICE IS TO EXPAND. THE INTRODUCTION
OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES SHOULD RELEASE STAFF TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE
SERVICE.
