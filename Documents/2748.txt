TOWARD USABLE USER STUDIES.
     
A MANAGEMENT-ORIENTED MODEL FOR DESCRIBING AND STUDYING INFORMATION BEHAVIOUR
IS PROPOSED. SEVERAL HYPOTHESES DERIVED FROM THE MODEL ARE TESTED USING A DATA
BASE DESCRIBING THE INFORMATION-RELATED ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS OF SOME 560
SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WORKING IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND ROLES. ALL BUT
ONE OF THE HYPOTHESES WERE CONFIRMED, ADDING SUPPORT TO THE MODEL.
