INTERLIBRARY LENDING OR DOCUMENT SUPPLY IN THE 1980S.
     
EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE ISSUE
LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE FACING IS THE MUCH WIDER ONE OF DOCUMENT SUPPLY.
WHILE THE INTERLIBRARY LENDING PROCEDURES WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AS AN
EXPRESSION OF VOLUNTARY COOPERATION BASED ON GOODWILL WERE ADEQUATE IN THE
1930S AND 1940S, THEY BECAME INADEQUATE IN THE 1960S AND 1970S AND WILL BRING
DISASTER, IF RETAINED, IN THE 1980S.
