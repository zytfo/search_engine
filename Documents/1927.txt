STUDIES ON 2ECONOMICS ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL1' A NEW ONLINE DATABASE.
     
DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF TEST SEARCHES CARRIED OUT ON 2ECONOMICS
ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL1 (EAI), A RELATIVELY NEW ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
BASE COVERING ECONOMICS AND MARKETING INFORMATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE DATA
BASE WAS COMPARED TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED PREDICASTS FAMILY OF DATA BASES. IT
WAS FOUND THAT THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY, IN THAT FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF SEARCH
(E.G. COMPANY INFORMATION), PREDICASTS IS A BETTER SERVICE AND FOR OTHERS
(E.G. THEORETICAL ECONOMICS) EAI IS SUPERIOR. IN THE FIELD OF MARKETING
INFORMATION, BOTH PROVIDE HITS. PREDICASTS IDENTIFIED SHORT, UP-TO-DATE NEWS
ITEMS AND EAI IN-DEPTH STUDIES. CRITICAL COMMENTS ARE MADE ON GEOGRAPHIC
COVERAGE, ON THE USE OF UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS FOR
SUBJECT-MATTER SEARCHING, AND ON THE TIMELINESS OF EAI.
