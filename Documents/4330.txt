ON SOME PROBLEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING AT THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
LIBRARY.
     
THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING LIBRARY USES A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE FOR
SUBJECT CATALOGUING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1970. IT IS BASED ON THE
HIERARCHIC UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF THE ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
THIS IS SUITABLE FOR THE STOCK OF THE WISMAR LIBRARY WHICH COVERS A VERY WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE HAS A FLEXIBLE NOTATION SYSTEM
WHICH CAN COVER COMPLEX TERMS EXTENDING TO 6 COLUMNS AND ALSO HAS KEYWORDS'
GENERAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL, LINGUISTIC AND LITERATURE. THE
SYSTEMATICS WORK AT THE WISMAR LIBRARY HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES' TO ADAPT THE
ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION TO THE SPECIALISED
WISMAR COLLECTION; TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM SCIENTIFIC
DEVELOPMENTS BY EXPANDING AND BRINGING UP TO DATE THE SCHEDULES; AND TO WORK
OUT NEW SYSTEMS IN CASES WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXISTING ONES ARE REACHED. WHERE
THIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY 2 C ATALOGUES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN EXISTENCE
SIMULTANEOUSLY TO AVOID LOSS OF INFORMATION FOR THE USER.
