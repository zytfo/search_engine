POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF SUCH DISCS IN MODERN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,
E.G. FOR PROVIDING REAL-TIME ACCESS TO SOURCE DOCUMENT ARCHIVES. CONCLUDES
THAT, PROVIDED PROBLEMS WITH RESOLUTION AND ARCHIVAL QUALITY ARE RESOLVED,
OPTICAL DISC TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL FIELD AND THAT DIGITAL OPTICAL RECORDING SYSTEMS USING THIN FILM
DISCS WILL BE VIABLE BY 1985-86 AND WILL BE PRESENTING MAJOR COMPETITION TO
COMPUTER-OUTPUT-MICROFORMS AND MAGNETIC TAPE STORAGE SYSTEMS BY 1990.
