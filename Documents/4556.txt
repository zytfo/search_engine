LIBRARIES AND THE UN'S INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED.
     
LIBRARIES HAVE A SPECIAL ROLE IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT
HANDICAPPED READERS GAINING ACCESS TO PRINTED MATERIAL. ARGUES THAT MOST OF
THE 50% IN DENMARK WHO ARE NOT LIBRARY USERS ARE MORE OR LESS HANDICAPPED.
SOME ARE HANDICAPPED FROM PHYSICAL CAUSES, AND OTHERS ARE SLOW OR NEW READERS
AND DYSLEXICS. DESCRIBES THE IMPORTANCE OF READING IN DAILY LIFE AND THE
REASONS FOR LACK OF SKILL IN READING. OUTLINES RULES FOR LANGUAGE AND LAY-OUT
WHICH MAKE A BOOK EASIER TO READ AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOK AIMED AT
DIFFERENT GROUPS ('ORDINARY' BOOKS, EASY READERS, MAGNAPRINT, BRAILLE, SPOKEN
BOOKS, BOOK 0 TAPE). THIS KIND OF MATERIAL IS GIVEN TOO LITTLE PRIORITY BY
PUBLISHERS AND LIBRARIES. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN DESIGN OF LIBRARIES
TO MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THE LIBRARY MUST DISSEMINATE ITS
SERVICES WIDELY TO THE HANDICAPPED. DURING THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES MAKE A SPECIAL  EFFORT AND ARE REPRESENTED ON LOCAL
ORGANISING COMMITTEES.
