OLD BOOKBINDING TECHNIQUES IN MODERN RESTORATION OF WRITTEN MATERIAL, 6' THE
CONSTRUCTION OF GLOBES.
     
THE FIRST GLOBE OF THE EARTH WAS MADE AT THE END OF THE 15TH CENTURY; GLOBES
OF THE HEAVENS WERE IN EXISTENCE SOME TIME EARLIER. METHODS OF GLOBE
MANUFACTURE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY ONWARDS ARE DESCRIBED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED
FOR CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT. GLOBE MANUFACTURE FREQUENTLY INVOLVES WORK BY A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRAFTSMEN. A GEOGRAPHER, MATHEMATICIAN OR ASTRONOMER
CREATES THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN, THEN A CARPENTER PROVIDES A BASIC WOODEN
STRUCTURE WHICH IS COVERED WITH PAPER PASTE. THE MAP MUST BE CUT INTO SECTIONS
BEFORE BEING FIXED ONTO THE GLOBE AND THEN A TOP LAYER OF LIME OR CHALK IS
ADDED. AN ALTERNATIVE MANUFACTURING METHOD IS TO FILL A POTTERY MOULD WITH
PAPER MACHE. POCKET GLOBES ARE OFTEN MADE ENTIRELY OF WOOD. A GLOBE MUST BE
LIGHT, EASILY TURNED BUT PERFECTLY BALANCED.
