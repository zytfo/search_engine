A SURVEY OF BUSINESS MANAGERS AND LIBRARY DIRECTORS TO IDENTIFY THE VARIABLES
AFFECTING THE FINAL DECISION ON LIBRARY BUDGETS IN INSTITUTIONS AWARDING AT
LEAST THE BACCALAUREATE, BUT LESS THAN THE DOCTORATE DEGREE.
     
(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) 75 INSTITUTIONS, 5.3% WERE RANDOMLY
SELECTED FROM A 1,412 POPULATION AND SURVEYED IN MAR 78. A TOTAL OF 125
(83.3%) QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED FROM 150 MAILED TO BUSINESS MANAGERS AND
LIBRARY DIRECTORS OF SAMPLE INSTITUTIONS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS RETURNED BY
EITHER THE BUSINESS MANAGER, LIBRARY DIRECTOR OR BOTH FROM 73 OF THE 75 SAMPLE
INSTITUTIONS GIVING AN INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE OF 97.3%. 49 BUDGETING VARIABLES
WERE IDENTIFIED BY LIBRARY DIRECTORS AND 45 BY BUSINESS MANAGERS WITH 38
COMMON VARIABLES. BY COMBINING THE WEIGHTED PERCENTAGE OF EACH VARIABLE, THE
OVERALL TOP 10 BUDGETING VARIABLES WERE FOUND. A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE ON
LIBRARIANSHIP AND HIGHER EDUCATION, AN ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE VARIABLES
AND THOSE IDENTIFIED BY TH E SAMPLE RESPONDENTS, REVEALED THAT THE VARIABLES
CHOSEN BY RESPONDENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE LITERATURE.
