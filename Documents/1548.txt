DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES AS MEANS OF MAKING LIBRARY SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVE.
     
THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES IN THE USSR, HUNGARY AND EAST
GERMANY ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED. IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
DECLARATION NO. 237 FROM 1977 AND THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT DECLARATION NO. 417
FROM THE SAME YEAR ARE CONCERNED WITH THE BUILDING OF DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
THE NATIONAL COORDINATION CENTRE WORKED OUT IN 1979 A PROPOSAL FOR THE CENTRAL
DEPOSITORY LIBRARY IN BRATISLAVA. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT THE LIBRARY WILL BE
BUILT IN ZABI MAJER NEAR RACA, CLOSE TO BRATISLAVA CITY. THE ACTUAL BUILDING
IS EXPECTED TO BE READY BY 1987; UP TO THIS TIME THE CENTRAL DEPOSITORY
LIBRARY WILL FUNCTION IN TEMPORARY PREMISES.
