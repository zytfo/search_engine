LIBERALISATION OF THE USE OF BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.
     
REPORT TO THE UK SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY, EXPLORING THE ECONOMIC
IMPLICATIONS OF LEASING THE BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS (BT) NETWORK TO OTHERS
WHO 'WOULD HAVE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES'. FINDS
THAT CONSUMER BENEFITS ARE LIKELY TO OUTWEIGH THE PROJECTED LOSS OF NET
REVENUE BY BT; BT SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECIDE PRICES AT WHICH CIRCUITS ARE TO BE
LEASED; AND BT SHOULD BE FREE TO ENGAGE IN COMPETITION FOR THE NON-VOICE
MARKETS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SAFEGUARDS AND PRO-COMPETITIVE MECHANISMS.
