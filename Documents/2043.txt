PARTICULAR PROBLEMS IN THE TRAINING OF HIGHER-QUALIFIED LIBRARY AND RESEARCH
STAFF.
     
MANY LIBRARY SCHOOLS SUFFER FROM HAVING TOO FEW QUALIFIED LECTURERS,
OVER-LOADED AND ILL-PLANNED SYLLABUSES, AND FROM PAYING TOO LITTLE ATTENTION
TO POST-GRADUATE WORK. UNTIL THESE FAULTS ARE REMEDIED THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF
IMPROVING SIGNIFICANTLY THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS. THERE IS A NEED
FOR A MORE GENERAL SYLLABUS, SO THAT STUDENTS EMERGE WITH DETAILED KNOWLEDGE
OF A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS NEED TO BE MORE
CAREFULLY SELECTED AND THEIR DISSERTATIONS MORE CLOSELY SUPERVISED.
