THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY, OXFORD.

BOOKS WERE FIRST TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY BUILDING IN
PECKWATER QUADRANGLE IN THE PERIOD 1763-70. THE POST OF LIBRARY KEEPER WAS
FILLED BY A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE. INITIALLY THE LIBRARY ONLY SERVED
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE. IN 1869 A LIBRARY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED TO
OVERSEE THE PURCHASE OF BOOKS AND THE COMPILING AND UPDATING OF CATALOGUES. AN
UNDERGRADUATE READING ROOM WAS SET UP APART FROM THE MAIN BUILDING IN 1884 AND
EXISTED UNTIL 1929. PROBLEMS ARISING FROM INEFFICIENCY AND A LACK OF SPACE
GAVE RISE TO A MAJOR REORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY'S RESOURCES IN THE 1930S.
AT THE PRESENT TIME NEW ACCESSIONS CURRENTLY RUN TO ABOUT 900 VOLUMES AND 160
PAMPHLETS PER ANNUM. ALL MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY
WHICH HAS THE BEST STOCK OF RESEARCH MATERIAL IN OXFORD, APART FROM THE
BODLEIAN.
