LEARNING SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF MASS SPECTRA.
     
A COMPUTER-ASSISTED MASS SPECTRAL INTERPRETATION SYSTEM WITH A LEARNING
MECHANISM IS DESCRIBED. THE SET OF CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN SUBSTRUCTURE AND
SPECTRAL COMPONENT (CSSC) IS USED FOR INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA. CSSC IS
GENERATED, RENEWED, AND IMPROVED AUTOMATICALLY IN THE SYSTEM. CHEMICAL
STRUCTURES ARE REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF BLOCKS, WHICH FACILITATES THE LEARNING
PROCESS.
