EXPERIENCES IN THE INTRODUCTION OF ON-LINE SERVICES IN INDUSTRY.

ON-LINE SERVICES HAVE BEEN OFFERED ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS IN WEST GERMANY SINCE
1975, BUT ARE STILL NOT WIDELY USED. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ON-LINE SERVICE USED IN
INDUSTRY IS DOKUMENTATION MASCHINENBAU (DOMA). THIS SERVICE HAS 17 USERS IN
INDUSTRY, MAINLY IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BRANCHES BUT ALSO IN ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL AND CONSUMER GOODS CONCERNS. THE USERS ARE GENERALLY
CONFINED TO LARGE SCALE BUSINESSES EMPLOYING BETWEEN 1,000-25,000 PEOPLE. TO
MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF THE DOMA SERVICE IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE BEEN RUNNING A
SUCCESSFUL DOCUMENTATION DEPARTMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, TO USE THE ON-LINE
SERVICE TO IMPLEMENT THE EXISTING INFORMATION ACTIVITY AND TO HAVE STAFF WHO
ARE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ON-LINE SERVICES. DOMA
PROVIDES PERSONNEL TRAINING AND HELPS WITH INSTALLATION OF HARDWARE BESIDES
PROVIDING ADVICE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD. THIS ASPECT OF ON-LINE SERVICES IS
VITAL AND TO UNDEREST IMATE LEADS TO UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS.
