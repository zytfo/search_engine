THE WRITTEN PRESS IN 1981.
     
A PAPER PREPARED FOR THE 1981 ASSOCIATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES FRANCAIS (ABF)
CONFERENCE DISCUSSING FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR THE PRESS IN RELATION TO THE
CHALLENGE OF OTHER MEDIA. SURVEYS THE HISTORY OF THE PRESS IN GENERAL SINCE
THE INVENTION OF PRINTING, AND SHOWS THAT TODAY THE PUBLIC PREFERS PRESS
REPORTAGE OF IMPORTANT EVENTS TO RADIO AND TELEVISION COVERAGE. SINCE THE WAR,
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PRESS AS WELL
AS PROMOTING RIVAL MEDIA. DESPITE SOCIAL CHANGES AND IMPROVED LIVING
STANDARDS, RADIO AND TELEVISION HAVE NOT REPLACED THE PRESS, BUT RATHER
SUPPLEMENT IT. THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL RADIO AND NATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORKS
REMAIN TO BE SEEN, BUT UNLIKE RADIO AND TELEVISION, THE PRESS IS NOT STATE
CONTROLLED. THE PUBLIC HAS ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE PRESS FOR COMMENT AND NEWS IN
EVENTFUL TIMES, AND WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO DO SO.
