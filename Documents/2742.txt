BOOK WEEK 1981 IN THE BERLIN SUBURB OF MARZAHN.
     
MARZAHN IS ONE OF THE LARGE, NEW URBAN AREAS IN EAST GERMANY. SINCE A NEW
LIBRARY IS NOT YET AVAILABLE, SERVICES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN 4 LIBRARIES IN THE
OLDER PART OF TOWN, A PROCESSING CENTRE AND SEVERAL 'MINILIBRARIES'
ESTABLISHED TEMPORARILY IN YOUTH CLUBS, OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES, HOSPITAL PREMISES
AND ADULT EDUCATION CENTRES. DURING BOOK WEEK, 31 DIFFERENT EVENTS FOR ADULTS
AND CHILDREN WERE ORGANISED, MAINLY IN THE LIBRARIES. THE PROGRAMME INCLUDED
SALE OF BOOKS, GRAPHIC WORKS, CERAMICS AND GLASS, LITERACY DISCUSSIONS AT CLUB
EVENINGS, POETRY RECITALS, QUIZZES AND BAZAARS, WITH THE WELCOME PARTICIPATION
OF 19 DIFFERENT AUTHORS. GOOD PUBLICITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVENTS OF THIS
NATURE.
