THESAURUS OF MUSIC CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO MOTIVE, PURPOSE AND CONTENT. A
GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE PROJECT.

THE NEED FOR A DEFINITIVE THESAURUS OF MUSIC HAS BEEN RECOGNISED FOR MANY
YEARS AND VARIOUS STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE METHOD OF
CATALOGUING MUSICAL CONTENT. THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE (DEUTSCHE
BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (DBI)) HAS BEEN WORKING ON A THESAURUS OF MUSIC SINCE
1978. 1 OF THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES IN THE PREPARATION WAS DECIDING WHICH
CRITERIA WERE NECESSARY FOR INDEXING MUSIC TITLES. WORK STARTED BY COLLECTING
MATERIAL AND EXAMINING EACH TITLE TO SEE WHETHER IT CONTAINED CERTAIN CONCEPTS
WHICH REFERRED TO THE CONTENT. THESE FORMED THE EMPIRIC BASE FOR THE THESAURUS
VOCABULARY. THE THESAURUS WILL CONTAIN 500-600 TERMS WHICH WILL BE THE FUTURE
PREFERRED INDEXING TERMS. THE PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED BUT IS READY TO BE
TESTED BY THE MUNICIPAL MUSIC LIBRARY IN MUNICH IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR
CATALOGUING ACTIVITY.
