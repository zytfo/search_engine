MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM' ISSUES IN CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL.
     
DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS, MICROFORM ACQUISITIONS HAVE GROWN AT AN INCREDIBLE
RATE ALONG WITH WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF INADEQUATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO
THESE MATERIALS. LOCAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OVER MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM HAS
BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM-RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE
CATALOGUING FOR THESE MATEIALS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT AND PRIORITY
ACCORDED TO SIMILAR MATERIALS IN HARD COPY. IDENTIFIES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE
MICROFORM PROBLEM, REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES REGARDING
THE CATALOGUING OF MICROFORMS AND SUGGESTS THAT INTEGRATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC
ACCESS BE IMPLEMENTED AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS IN THE USA.
