OCLC'S ROLE IN THE CONSER PROJECT.

THE CONSER PROJECT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES, INC.,
TO DEVELOP A HIGH QUALITY DATA BASE OF SERIAL CATALOGUING INFORMATION. OCLC
HOSTS THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROJECT. THE OCLC ON-LINE UNION CATALOG IS THE RESULT OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE CONSER PROJECT.
