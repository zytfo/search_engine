AN OPTIMIZING APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF INTERDEPARTMENTAL ALLOCATION OF THE
LIBRARY MATERIALS BUDGET.

PRESENTS A FORMAL, MATHEMATICALLY EXPRESSED HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE EFFECT
OF LIBRARY SPENDING BY DEPARTMENTS ON PATRON WELFARE; THEN DERIVES A FORMULA
AS THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF MAXIMISING PATRON WELFARE SUBJECT TO THE
BUDGET CONSTRAINT THAT THE SUM OF THE ALLOCATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENTS EQUALS
THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA, THE APPROPRIATE SHARE OF
EACH DEPARTMENT DEPENDS ON ITS NUMBERS, ITS COST OF LITERATURE, AND ON THE
VALUES OF A UTILITY FUNCTION PARAMETER AND A SELECTIVITY FUNCTION PARAMETER.
DISCUSSES MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS, AND GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION USING DATA
FROM THE WESTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY.
