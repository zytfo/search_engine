A FEW WORDS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE, HENRY MILLER AND WHAT BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE
ARE.

RUMINATES ON WHAT MAKES PUBLIC LIBRARIANS EMBARK ON THEIR CHOSEN CAREER AND
SUGGESTS THAT EACH IS ENGAGED IN WRITING HIS OWN VERSION OF HENRY MILLER'S THE
BOOKS IN MY LIFE (IN WHICH MILLER DISCUSSES WHAT CERTAIN BOOKS AND WRITERS
HAVE MEANT TO HIM). EVERY TIME A PATRON ASKS A LIBRARIAN TO SUGGEST A TITLE,
THE LIBRARIAN THINKS BACK, MAKES A SUGGESTION, WRITES ANOTHER CHAPTER IN HIS
VERSION OF MILLER'S BOOK, AND REPAYS THE DEBT OWED TO THE SUGGESTED TITLE'S
AUTHOR (FOR ENRICHING THE LIBRARIAN'S LIFE) BY KEEPING HIS WORDS ALIVE.
