GUIDANCE OF INDIVIDUAL READING AS A WORTHWHILE ACTIVITY.

IN A TIME WHEN LIBRARIANS HAVE TO WORK WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF READERS WITH
DEMANDS OF EVER-INCREASING COMPLEXITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ORGANISE PRECISELY
THE WORK OF INDIVIDUAL READING GUIDANCE. THE PROCESS BY WHICH A READER SELECTS
A BOOK CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO VARIOUS STAGES AND DECISIONS, AND THE LIBRARIAN
CAN EXERT A POSITIVE INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. IF THE AIMS AND STAGES
OF THE LIBRARIAN'S GUIDANCE ARE PLANNED SCHEMATICALLY BEFOREHAND, IT IS
POSSIBLE TO RECORD EACH READER'S PROGRESS AND REACTIONS IN A CONCISE CODED
SYSTEM WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR MOST PUBLIC LIBRARY SITUATIONS.
