EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. NEW POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION WITHIN
UNIVERSITIES.
     
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO
MAKE ACADEMIC UNIVERSITY WORK CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE TO THE OUTSIDER. 1 WAY IS
THROUGH WELL-ORGANISED PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. AN
EXHIBITION WHICH WAS ORGANISED BY STUDENTS OF THE HISTORY OF ART DEPARTMENT AT
FREIBERG UNIVERSITY IN JUNE/JULY 80 WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF
ACTIVITY. THE STUDENTS ARRANGED CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA, THE ACTUAL EXHIBITION
OBJECTS, CONTACT WITH THE ARTISTS, PUBLICITY, AN OPENING AT WHICH THE ARTISTS
WERE PRESENT, GUIDES TO THE EXHIBITION, WORKSHOPS, TALKS AND PUBLIC
DISCUSSIONS. ALL THE LIBRARY HAD TO DO WAS PROVIDE THE EXHIBITION ROOMS. THE
EXHIBITION WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND ACTED AS A STIMULUS TO OTHER GROUPS
WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY TO ORGANISE SIMILAR EXHIBITIONS TO PRESENT THEIR CURRENT
WORK PROJECTS TO THE PUBLIC.
