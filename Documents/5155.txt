MICROCOMPUTERS AS A MODERN BASE FOR AUTOMATING LIBRARY, INFORMATION AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSES.

THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS BEEN FACED WITH THE NEED TO CREATE AUTOMATED
SYSTEMS FOR COORDINATING STOCK SELECTION, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION WORK AND
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING. THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE A CAPACITY
FOR SELECTING, STORING, RETRIEVING AND PRESENTING INFORMATION, HIGH
RELIABILITY AND LOW COST. THE EXPENSE OF LARGE COMPUTERS HAS RETARDED THEIR
USE IN LOCALISED SITUATIONS, BUT THE MICROCOMPUTER CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
BEFORE CHOOSING A COMPUTER, IT IS WORTHWHILE CONSIDERING THE FEATURES OF EACH
TYPE AND THE OPINIONS OF WORLD EXPERTS. THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS FOUND THAT
A MICROCOMPUTER CAN MEET ITS REQUIREMENTS PERFECTLY SATISFACTORILY.
