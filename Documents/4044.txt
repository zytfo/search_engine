THIRTY YEARS OF THE 2BIBLIOTEKAR1.
     
A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ALMOST 30 YEARS OF 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1HISTORY.
INADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAVE MEANT THAT AUTHORS FEES ARE NOT GENEROUS,
AND THE QUALITY OF THE PUBLISHED MATERIAL SUFFERS. IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO
IMPROVE THE JOURNAL'S LAYOUT, ALTHOUGH THE PRINTING FACILITIES AT THE CYRIL
AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY ARE GRATEFULLY APPRECIATED. CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS
SHOULD IMPROVE 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1QUALITY AND IMAGE, E.G. ARTICLES SHOULD BE
PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY AND OTHER
MAJOR LIBRARIES. FREELANCE CORRESPONDENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SHOULD REPORT
REGULARLY ABOUT LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS. OTHER FREELANCE COLLABORATORS,
WITH A GOOD COMMAND OF MODERN LANGUAGES, SHOULD PROVIDE REVIEWS OF FOREIGN
PERIODICALS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND DESIGNATE ARTICLES WORTHY OF FULL TRANSLATION
INTO BULGARIAN. A SPECIAL COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO SPECIFY
2BIBLIOTEKAR'S1 STATUTE WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS THE ONLY
JOURNAL CATERING FOR ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA.
