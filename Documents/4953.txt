JAPANESE NEWSPAPERS AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
     
THE JAPANESE ATTITUDE TO NEWSPAPERS AND NEW ELECTRONIC MEDIA IS DISCUSSED. THE
JAPANESE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN A HEALTHY STATE. HOWEVER
THERE ARE CLOSED LINKS BETWEEN NEWSPAPERS, TELEVISION AND RADIO, IN SPITE OF
LEGISLATION DISCOURAGING THIS, BECAUSE NEWSPAPER MANAGERS SEE A THREAT AND AN
OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEW MEDIA. THE NEW MEDIA PARTICULARLY MENTIONED ARE
TELETEXT, VIDEOTEX AND VIDEO TAPES AND VIDEO DISCS.
