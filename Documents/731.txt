THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF R & D.

NOTE. AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, (1) 1980, 63-65. SUGGESTS THAT INFORMATION
CENTRES ARE IN THE POSITION TO EVALUATE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL POTENTIAL
OF R & D GROUPS AND TO FORECAST LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE CONNECTED
WITH NEW PROJECTS. SUCH EVALUATIONS MUST BE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE
DATA, INVENTIONS AND TECHNICAL REPORTS; THE RANGE OF THE DOCUMENTATION COVERED
BY THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE.
