THE INCORPORATION OF PATENT INFORMATION IN THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON CIVIL
ENGINEERING.

IF MORE INFORMATION ON PATENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE CIVIL ENGINEERING
INFORMATION SYSTEM, WIDER AND MORE RATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WILL RESULT AND MORE
HELP CAN BE GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES SHOULD PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OF LITERATURE,
SEARCHING, SELECTIVE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMAL STOCK
OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MATERIAL ON PATENTS, AN EXPRESS COPYING SERVICE,
PRODUCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION
SERVICES. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD SHOW IMPROVED COOPERATION WITH OTHER
PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND WITH SERVICE USERS AND MORE RESEARCH INTO
TERMINOLOGY AND STAFF TRAINING METHODS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD RELEASE SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH WORKERS FROM MUCH ROUTINE WORK.
