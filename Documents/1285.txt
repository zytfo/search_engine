COMPUTER-AIDED SPECTRAL IDENTIFICATION OF LASER-INDUCED PLASMA EMMISSION.

THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELECTRONIC EMISSION SPECTRA PRODUCED BY A LASER-INDUCED
PLASMA MAY BE PERFORMED BY COMPUTER ANALYSIS. PRESENTS 2 ALGORITHMS FOR
MATCHING SUCH SPECTRA AGAINST STANDARD TABLES. THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF
THE 2 ALGORITHMS ARE ANALYSED.
