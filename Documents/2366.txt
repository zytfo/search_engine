PROBLEMS IN ESTABLISHING A NAME AUTHORITY FILE FOR NIGERIAN AUTHORS.
     
ESTABLISHING NAME AUTHORITY FILES IN SUCH MULTILINGUAL NATIONS AS NIGERIA IS
COMPLICATED BY THE EXISTENCE OF SOME 400 LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS, ALTHOUGH ONLY
ABOUT 15% OF THESE HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OR USED IN PUBLICATIONS; ENGLISH IS USED
AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND THE MEDIUM OF INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN TRIBES.
TRADITIONALLY, NIGERIANS HAVE BEEN KNOWN BY THEIR GIVEN NAMES DERIVED FROM 4
CATEGORIES' CIRCUMSTANCE OF BIRTH, RELIGION OF THE FAMILY CLAN, PROFESSION OF
THE FAMILY, AND HISTORY OF PREVIOUS BIRTHS. WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE ENGLISH
AND OTHER EUROPEANS, ELEMENTS OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED
INTO THE NAMING SYSTEM. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
