THE NEW TEACHING LIBRARY.
     
ARGUES THAT TECHNICAL SERVICES HAVE BECOME THE PIVOT OF CHANGE IN US
LIBRARIES, AND THAT BECAUSE OF THIS, A NEW LEVEL OF LIBRARY EDUCATION IN
TECHNICAL SERVICES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL IS URGENTLY NEEDED. SUGGESTS A
NEW APPROACH TO TEACHING WHICH WOULD INVOLVE' THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING
LIBRARIES; THE MERGER OF LIBRARY AND LIBRARY SCHOOL ORGANISATION; AND THE
NURTURING OF REALISTIC, GOAL ORIENTATED RESEARCH IN A PRACTICAL SETTING.
