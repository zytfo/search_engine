THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT CENSORSHIP?.

REPLY TO AN ARTICLE BY E.J. GROESKAMP IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN SAMENLEVING 9 (12) DEC
81, 333-337 (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF WHICH 2SEE1 82/4167), IN WHICH ATTENTION WAS
DRAWN TO THE HIDDEN CENSORSHIP PRACTISED BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES. GROESKAMP'S
DEFINITION OF CENSORSHIP SHOULD MORE PROPERLY BE TERMED 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL
GROUNDS'. BECAUSE OF LACK OF SPACE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, LIBRARIES CANNOT
PURCHASE ALL BOOKS PUBLISHED AND SELECTION IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A BALANCED
COLLECTION OF MATERIAL. THE FACTS ON WHICH GROESKAMP'S ARGUMENTS ARE BASED
INCLUDE 2 LIBRARY SURVEYS, OF WHICH 1 CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT DATA TO DRAW ANY
FIRM CONCLUSIONS, WHILE THE OTHER PRODUCED RESULTS IN CONFLICT WITH
GROESKAMP'S DEDUCTIONS. FOR FINANCIAL REASONS IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT IN A
COMMUNITY OF 1 RELIGIOUS PERSUASION FEW BOOKS OF A DIFFERENT PERSUASION ARE
LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY.
