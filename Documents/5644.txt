THE BAVARIAN SECTION OF THE VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE AN OFFENTLICHEN
BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) HELD AN ADVANCED
TRAINING SESSION IN MAR 82 ON THE USE OF COMICS AND OTHER STORIES IN PICTURE
FORM IN LIBRARIES. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED INCLUDED' THE HISTORY OF COMICS IN THE
USA, FRANCE AND GERMANY; TERMINOLOGY; MARKETING AND PRODUCTION; PURCHASING;
AND THE USES OF THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL FOR ADULTS, YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS
IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. POPULAR THEMES IN COMICS INCLUDE ADVENTURE, TRAVEL,
ANIMALS AND MEN AND SUPERMAN INVOLVED IN THE CONQUEST OF EVIL. WHILE A
REGRETTABLE TENDENCY TOWARDS VIOLENT AND AGGRESSIVE MATERIAL IS APPARENT, THE
TENDENCY IS OFTEN LESS STRONG HERE THAN IN OTHER MEDIA.
