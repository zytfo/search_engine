STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' REACTIONS TO A REPORT (PART) 2.

PART 1 OF THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN SAMENLEVING 9 (2) FEB 81,
46-51 (SEE 81/5155). THE GUIDELINES FOR STANDARDS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE
PUBLISHED IN 1980 IN THE NETHERLANDS BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE COORDINATION OF
STANDARDS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CONTAIN NO DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND TO
THE SUGGESTED STANDARDS. SOME SECTIONS OF THE REPORT CONTAIN CONSIDERABLY
GREATER DETAIL THAN OTHERS, WHICH GIVES THE REPORT AN UNBALANCED APPEARANCE.
IT IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY THAT NO STANDARDS FOR STAFFING ARE INCLUDED. IN
COMPARISON WITH THE IFLA STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND THOSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE
STANDARDS HERE PROPOSED ARE SOMEWHAT LOW. ONLY EXPERIENCE IN PRACTICAL USE CAN
SHOW WHETHER THEY ARE ADEQUATE.
