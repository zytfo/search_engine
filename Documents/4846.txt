FOR DATA PROCESSING IN POSTGRADUATE COMPUTER SCIENCE (CPD/PGCC) AT UFRS,
BRAZIL' METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THE COMPOSITION
OF THE NUCLEAR COLLECTION, THEN TO ESTABLISH INTEREST PROFILES AND CRITERIA
FOR WEEDING AND ACQUISITION OF NEW TITLES. DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM LIBRARY
RECORDS AND BY INTERVIEWS WITH THE HEADS OF RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS. IN ADDITION
TO REALISING THE INITIAL OBJECTIVES, THE SURVEY ALSO DREW ATTENTION TO A GROUP
OF PERIODICALS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE, TO BE MONITORED FOR POSSIBLE WEEDING.
COLLABORATION WITH THE RESEARCH WORKERS WAS FOUND VERY USEFUL, AND A POLICY OF
FURTHER COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND RESEARCH STAFF INITIATED. THE RESULTS
OF THE STUDY ARE PRESENTED IN FULL IN THE APPENDIX.
