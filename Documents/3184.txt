INDISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.
     
LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLE
ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.
CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESE
SYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,
BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.
SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERS
REGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS. THIS FACT TODAY
SEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED WHEN LIBRARIES DECIDE ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF
AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM.
