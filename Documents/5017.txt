REFERENCE BOOK OR TEXTBOOK?.

IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE VIEWS OF LECTURERS AND STUDENTS ON THE 2ND EDITION
OF 2BIBLIOTHEEK EN DOKUMENTATIE' HANDBOEK TEN DIENSTE VAN DE OPLEIDINGEN1
(2LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION' A HANDBOOK FOR STUDENTS1) PUBLISHED IN 1979,
THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF 2OPEN1 CIRCULATED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ALL LIBRARY
SCHOOLS IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST LECTURERS AND
STUDENTS MADE USE OF THE BOOK, ALTHOUGH A FEW HAD NOT USED IT AT ALL, BECAUSE,
THEY FELT, CERTAIN TOPICS WERE INSUFFICIENTLY COVERED, INCLUDING AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS, CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION. THE RESULTS ALSO
SHOWED THAT THE BOOK WAS USED MORE AS A TEXTBOOK TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
ADDITIONAL TO THAT OBTAINED IN LECTURES, RATHER THAN AS A REFERENCE BOOK.
HOWEVER, ON THE WHOLE MOST RESPONDENTS FELT THE BOOK TO BE A USEFUL
INTRODUCTION TO LIBRARIANSHIP.
