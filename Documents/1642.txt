REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION SERVICE.
     
THE JAPAN MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL ASSOCIATION OF
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN JAPAN. IT OWES MUCH FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT TO THE USA AND
EUROPE, AND AS SUCH HAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTACT WITH MEDICAL LIBRARIES IN ASIAN,
AND PARTICULARLY SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES. WHILST THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MEDICAL
INFORMATION CENTER (SEAMIC) HELD ITS 1ST WORKSHOP IN TOKYO IN 1973, THE
PROBLEM OF THE VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION IS A BARRIER TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ONLY BY REMOVING
THESE BARRIERS AND ESTABLISHING STRONG REGIONAL COOPERATION, CAN INFORMATION
BE EXCHANGED FREELY, WHICH WILL BE A SURE STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL
INFORMATION.
