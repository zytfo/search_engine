COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 2.
GENSAL, A FORMAL LANGUAGE FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL, IS DESCRIBED WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR THE CONCISE AND
UNAMBIGUOUS REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC STRUCTURES FROM CHEMICAL PATENTS
('MARKUSH FORMULAS') IN A MANNER WHICH IS INTELLIGIBLE TO A CHEMIST, YET
SUFFICIENTLY FORMALISED FOR AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS BY A COMPUTER. GENSAL CONTAINS
A NUMBER OF FACILITIES FOR SHOWING THE ALTERNATIVES POSSIBLE IN A GENERIC
STRUCTURE AND ANY SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEIR VARIETY. EXPERIENCE TO
DATE SUGGESTS THAT GENSAL IS CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH MOST OF THE TYPES OF
GENERIC STATEMENT ENCOUNTERED IN PATENTS.
