THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN SOCIETY.
     
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AN ANALYSIS OF FIRSTLY, THE NEED FOR AND FUNCTIONS
OF COMMUNICATION IN SOCIETY; SECONDLY, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE RECORD AS A MEANS
OF COMMUNICATION; AND THIRDLY, THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN AGENT OF
COMMUNICATION IN ACTIVATING THE RECORD, THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY ARE STATED AS THE ADVANCEMENT OF CULTURE, THE PROVISION OF USEFUL
INFORMATION, AND RECREATION. THEN THE QUESTION IS CONSIDERED WHETHER THE
PROVISION OF RECREATIONAL MATERIALS 2PER SE1 SHOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY AND WHETHER THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS NOT WEAKENING ITS POSITION IN
SOCIETY BY PROVIDING RECREATIONAL READING MATERIALS ON A LARGE SCALE, THUS
COMPETING WITH COMMERCIAL SOURCES OF RECREATION.
