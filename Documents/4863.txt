THE CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN FRANCONIA.
     
CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN FRANCONIA WAS BEGUN IN 1977 BY THE
WURZBURG UNIVERSITY. THE CATALOGUE PROVIDES LISTS OF LOCATIONS IN ROMAN
CATHOLIC AND EVANGELICAL PARISH CHURCHES. MOST OF THE 1,550 ROMAN CATHOLIC
ITEMS ARE SETTINGS OF THE MASS; THERE IS LITTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC APART FROM
SOME 19TH CENTURY ORGAN PIECES. THE 600 MANUSCRIPTS FROM EVANGELICAL CHURCHES
ARE MOSTLY IN THE ROSSACH COLLECTION, DATING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE 18TH
CENTURY. MANY COMPOSITIONS ARE BY WELL-KNOWN COMPOSERS FROM OUTSIDE FRANCONIA
OF THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES. COLLECTIONS OWNED BY NOBLE FAMILIES CONTAIN
MOSTLY SECULAR SONGS, PIANO AND CHAMBER MUSIC. MOST OF THE MANUSCRIPTS ARE IN
GOOD CONDITION; A FEW SUFFERING FROM DAMP REQUIRED LABORATORY TREATMENT. THE
PRINTED MUSIC DOCUMENTED AT THE SAME TIME WAS MOSTLY FROM THE 19TH CENTURY.
