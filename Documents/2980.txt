PUBLICATIONS, DOCUMENTATION AND MEANS FOR THEIR DISSEMINATION IN THE
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES.
     
BASED ON DISCUSSIONS CONDUCTED WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE COMMISSION OF THE
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES DURING A STUDY VISIT TO BRUSSELS, NOV 79. UK MEMBERSHIP
OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES HAS ADDED A NEW DIMENSION TO THE NATIONAL
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND HAS GENERATED A FRESH BODY OF LEGISLATIVE AND
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION. IT HAS ALSO PROVIDED LIBRARIANS WITH A NEW SERIES OF
CHALLENGES. THE STUDY VISIT WAS CONCEIVED AS A FACT-FINDING EXERCISE TO GATHER
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMMUNITY'S PUBLISHING
PROGRAMME AND DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. CONSEQUENTLY, THE REPORT CONTAINS SEPARATE
CHAPTERS ON COMMUNITY PUBLICATIONS POLICY, ON THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS
OF COMMISSION DOCUMENTS (AS DISTINCT FROM PUBLICATIONS) AND ON THE RANGE OF
AUTOMATED INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL SERVICES OFFERED TO MEMBERS OF STAFF WITHIN
THE COMMISSION. ALSO CONTAINS A CHAPTER ON EUROPEAN DOCUMENTAT ION CENTRES AND
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
