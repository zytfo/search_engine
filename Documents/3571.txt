AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES OF NEPAL.
     
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN NEPAL IS UNDER PRESSURE TO HELP INCREASE FOOD
PRODUCTION. LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH ARE FOUND AT KHUMALTAR,
KIRTIPUR, KATMANDU AND TERAL. DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE LIBRARIES ARE GIVEN.
EFFECTIVE USE OF AVAILABLE LIBRARY RESOURCES IS LIMITED BY THE LACK OF
ORGANISATION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AND BY THE ABSENCE OF INTERLIBRARY
CO-OPERATION. TRAINED LIBRARY PERSONNEL ARE NEEDED TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION
AND PLANS ARE BEING MADE TO OBTAIN THEM.
