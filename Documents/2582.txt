LIBRARY SERVICES IN INDONESIA.
     
AS PART OF A PROGRAMME OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA
HAS LAID GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE PROVISION OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR ALL
SECTORS OF THE POPULATION. AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS PROGRAMME THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DRAWN UP PLANS FOR THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL NETWORK OF
LIBRARY SERVICES TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION FOR THE CULTURAL AND RECREATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
IN 1974 THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE CREATED THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR
LIBRARY SERVICES TO SUPERVISE THE CARRYING OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME. IN THE LAST
5 YEARS A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES HAS BEEN SET UP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,
INCLUDING 19 REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES AND A NEW NATIONAL LIBRARY, AND 2,000
STAFF HAVE RECEIVED LIBRARY TRAINING.
