PRINCIPLES FOR PRESERVING AND RESTORING LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.
     
THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS ARE
SET OUT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF IFLA'S PRESERVATION
SECTION. THE AIM OF THE PRINCIPLES IS TO INCREASE LIBRARY STAFF'S AWARENESS OF
THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING AND RESTORING NOT ONLY ARCHIVE MATERIAL BUT ALSO
CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE COLLECTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT OF
SUITABLE STORAGE FACILITIES. MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGH
UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES
(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF
THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE
USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS
UNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TO
FALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL .
