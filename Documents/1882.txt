A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS COLLECTIONS.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON'S ROESCH LIBRARY REQUIRED A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR
ITS LOCAL DOCUMENTS COLLECTION. IT NEEDED A SCHEME THAT WOULD ASSIGN EACH
TITLE A UNIQUE CALL NUMBER. EXISTING SCHEMES WERE EXAMINED BUT REJECTED. A NEW
ALPHANUMERIC SCHEME WAS DEVISED. IT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR COLLECTIONS
LIMITED TO PUBLICATIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC ORGANISATIONS OF NO MORE
THAN SEVERAL COUNTIES.
