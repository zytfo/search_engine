LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.
     
THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2 QUESTIONS' WHETHER
COMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM IN
PARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFF
BECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPERTS. AS PROCESSES BECOME AUTOMATED THEY ALSO BECOME
DEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.
SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOME
ROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIER
TO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THE
LIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,
EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THE
COST OF GATHERING OF STATISTICS THROUGH THROUGH BUMS AND TRAINING OF STAFF IN
DATA TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SET AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF THE RESOURCES.
