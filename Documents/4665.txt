LOCAL LIBRARY PERIODICALS.
     
COOPERATION AND COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LITERATURE SUPPLY ARE THE
ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS WHICH WERE SET UP IN THE
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE WAKE OF THE UNIVERSITY REFORM. HOWEVER, THE NEW
STRUCTURES REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CURRENT AND CONTINUOUS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS. LOCAL LIBRARY JOURNALS CAN
CONTRIBUTE CONSIDERABLY TO COMMUNICATION ON THE PREMISES. THEY MAKE THE
LIBRARY SYSTEMS INTELLIGIBLE AND THEY SERVE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
STRENGTHEN THE CONTACTS BETWEEN LIBRARIES. AS THEY PROMOTE COOPERATION BY THE
INTERLOCKING AND SUPPLY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THEY PROVIDE FURTHER
RATIONALE FOR COOPERATION IN LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
