ON ALLOCATIONS TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA
IN THE PERIOD FROM 1975 TO 1980.

THE NEW BUDGET ACCOUNTING SYSTEM INTRODUCED IN 1975 WAS SUCCESSFUL AND
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN APPROPRIATIONS OF FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS AND EXPENDITURE
WERE KEPT WITHIN LIMITS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALLOCATIONS AVAILABLE TO
LIBRARIES FOR LITERATURE ACQUISITION ROSE BY 27%. LIBRARY POSTS AVAILABLE
DURING THE PERIOD ROSE BY 7.7% (150 POSTS). MOST NEW PERSONNEL WERE
CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND ALSO IN THE
TRADITIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. OVER 3 MILLION DM WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR
AUTOMATION PROCESSES AT LIBRARIES IN 1980. ALTOUGH MANY NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS
WERE ERECTED IN THE PERIOD THERE IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENT SPACE FOR
ACCOMMODATING ALL THE NECESSARY LITERATURE. FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS WERE
INCREASED FOR THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY CENTRE, THE CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY
(ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN) AND THE INSTITUTE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, ALTHOUGH
ACCOMMODATION HERE IS STILL UNSATISFACTORY.
