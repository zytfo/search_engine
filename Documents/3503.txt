EXCERPTS FROM MY BOUBOULINA FILE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN A TEXTBOOK AUTHOR'S AGREEING TO ALLOW STICKERS TO BE PLACED OVER
PORTIONS OF HER BOOK FOUND OBJECTIONABLE BY A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND A
SUCCESSFUL WRITER'S AGREEING TO EXPURGATE PORTIONS OF HIS NOVEL TO CUT COSTS.
EXAMINES THESE DIFFERENCES BY TRACING THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF CENSORSHIP WITH
WHICH AUTHORS MUST DEAL FROM ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN AN AUTHOR ON 1 SIDE AND
EDITORS, PUBLISHERS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ON THE OTHER.
EXAMPLES FROM EACH LINK IN THE CHAIN ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH EXCERPTS FROM THE
AUTHOR'S PERSONAL FILE ON CENSORSHIP, CALLED 'BOUBOULINA'.
