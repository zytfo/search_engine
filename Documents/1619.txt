LIMITS TO COLLABORATIVE AUTHORSHIP IN SCIENCE PUBLISHING.
     
EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TENDENCY FOR INCREASED
COLLABORATION IN SCIENCE PUBLISHING DOES NOT PROCEED WITHOUT LIMIT. THERE
APPEARS TO BE A MAXIMUM EXTENT OF COLLABORATION, RELATED TO THE OPTIMUM SIZE
OF A RESEARCH UNIT. EMPIRICAL CORRECTIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE SOCIOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VARIOUS SCIENCE SUBJECTS ENABLE A GENERALISED CURVE TO BE
GENERATED WHICH APPEARS TO BE A FEATURE OF RESEARCH GROUPS' DYNAMICS. THE
STUDY INCORPORATES PUBLICATION DATA FROM ONE RESEARCH DIVISION OVER THE LAST
FIFTY YEARS, WITH THE TIME-INDEPENDENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BY
INTERPOLATION WITH SIMILAR DATA FOR 13 OTHER NEW ZEALAND RESEARCH DIVISIONS
FOR THE PERIOD 1970 TO 1977.
