KRANTEL-A JOINT VENTURE BY DUTCH NEWSPAPERS.
     
THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THE NETHERLANDS TO MAKE NEWSPAPERS AVAILABLE
THROUGH THE VIDITEL VIEWDATA SERVICE OF THE DUTCH POST OFFICE IS REPORTED.
KRANTEL IS A PROJECT DESIGNED TO HELP NEWSPAPERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY VIEWDATA. ALTHOUGH 10 NEWSPAPERS HAVE EXPERIMENTED
WITH THEIR OWN VIEWDATA SYSTEMS, COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IS LOW, AND SOME REASONS
FOR THIS ARE SUGGESTED.
