ASPECTS OF DATA COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER NETWORKS.
     
OUTLINES THE PRESENT STATE OF COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS. THE
CONFIGURATION OF DATA COMMUNICATIONS IS CHANGING FROM A STAR-LIKE TO MESH-LIKE
LAYOUT IN WHICH MANY COMPUTERS AND TERMINALS ARE CONNECTED THROUGH A DIGITAL
DATA NETWORK. PUBLIC DATA NETWORKS PROVIDING EITHER PACKET- OR
CIRCUIT-SWITCHING ARE IN SERVICE. NETWORK ARCHITECTURES PERMITTING CONNECTION
OF COMPUTERS AND TERMINALS OF DIFFERENT MAKES AND MODELS ARE COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING STANDARDISED INTERNATIONALLY.
PACKET-SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO ENCOMPASS COMMUNICATIONS
SATELLITES, RADIO, AND LOCAL HOOPS.
