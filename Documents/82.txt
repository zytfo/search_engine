LIBRARIES AND THE ORGANIZATION OF UNIVERSITIES IN FRANCE, 1789-1881.

EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF PROMOTING LIBRARIES AND THE
PROMOTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION CONVERGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRENCH
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THE REVOLUTION OF 1789 ABOLISHED
UNIVERSITIES AND CONFISCATED THEIR LIBRARIES. THE IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY, AN
EDUCATIONAL BUREAUCRACY THAT SURVIVED THE EMPIRE AND ENDURED FOR MOST OF THE
19TH CENTURY, DID NOT PROMOTE RESEARCH OR REQUIRE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. HOWEVER,
IN 1855 EFFORTS BEGAN TO REPLACE THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM WITH AUTONOMOUS
UNIVERSITIES, AND THESE EFFORTS FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
IN 1881 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WERE CREATED IN THE PROVINCES AS A 1ST STEP
TOWARD CREATING UNIVERSITIES, 15 YEARS BEFORE THE DE JURE ESTABLISHMENT OF
UNIVERSITIES.
