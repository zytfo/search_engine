EVANGELICAL PARISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES PAST AND PRESENT.

PROTESTANT PARISH LIBRARIES IN GERMANY BEGAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY, PARTLY
THROUGH MISSIONARY IMPULSES AND PARTLY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHOOL
SYSTEM. THEIR WORK WAS INTERRUPTED IN THE 1930S AND BEGAN AGAIN IN 1945, WHEN
WALTER SCHWARZ AND EVA LINDBER REFOUNDED THE DEUTSCHE VERBAND EVANGELISCHER
BUCHEREIEN (GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICAL LIBRARIES), WHICH HAS OVERALL
CONTROL OF THE PARISH LIBRARIES, PROVIDING ADVICE, ORGANISING CONFERENCES AND
COMPILING STATISTICS. A LIBRARY SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED WHICH HAD TO CLOSE IN THE
1970S THROUGH LACK OF FUNDS. THE PARISH LIBRARIES ARE STAFFED MAINLY BY
VOLUNTEERS, FOR WHOM SHORT TRAINING COURSES ARE PROVIDED, WITH PROFESSIONAL
STAFF IN TOP POSTS. A QUARTERLY PERIODICAL IS PUBLISHED CONTAINING LIBRARY
NEWS AND 1,800 REVIEWS ANNUALLY OF NEW PUBLICATIONS, FOR ONE OF WHICH AN
ANNUAL BOOK PRIZE IS AWARDED.
