THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN IN HIS FIELD AND THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.

ARGUES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD EMPLOY SPECIALISED PERSONNEL TO EXPAND
LIBRARY INVOLVEMENT IN THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE
COMMUNITY. BEFORE 1960, LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARIES PROVIDED ONLY LIMITED
SERVICES TO A MINORITY OF USERS; WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
SPECIALISED TRAINING, THE LIBRARIAN MUST MEET THE CHALLENGE OF RESPONDING TO
THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION NEEDS OF ALL CITIZENS, AND COMBAT THE
COMPETITION BOOKS FACE FROM OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. OUTLINES RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARIES AND THE PROFESSION, AND PRESENTS A VIEW OF THE
LIBRARY IN THE COMING DECADES AS AN AGENT IN THE PROMOTION OF READING, THE
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, AND SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGE.
