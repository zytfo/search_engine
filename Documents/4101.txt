SCHOOL LIBRARY-PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
REPORT OF A LECTURE GIVEN TO THE ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, 1981 BY PETER SEEBERG. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN DENMARK IS REVIEWED AND DOUBTS ARE CAST ON THE GENUINENESS
OF OFFICIAL DANISH LIBERALISM IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ATTITUDE
TO LIBRARIES. SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ORIGINATED FROM 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS' IN SCHOOLS CHILDREN HAD OTHERS TO THINK FOR THEM; LIBRARIES IN
DENMARK AROSE FROM THE LATE 19TH CENTURY IDEA OF CULTURE FOR ALL AND ACCESS
FOR ALL TO EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW. BY THE 1930S LIBRARIES HAD BECOME
INSTIGATORS OF CULTURE, WITH LECTURES AS WELL AS BOOKS AVAILABLE, AND WERE
REGARDED AS PROGRESSIVE IN ALL ITS MEANINGS. THIS IS STILL THE AIM OF
LIBRARIES TODAY, BUT SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES HAVE ALWAYS BELONGED TOGETHER AND
INTEGRATION OF THE 2 IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE.
