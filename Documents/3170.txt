METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES.
     
THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF BULGARIA IS TO TRANSFORM ALL BULGARIAN
CITIZENS INTO HARMONIOUS PERSONALITIES. THIS EFFORT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL
PARTICIPATION BY LIBRARIES, BOTH PUBLIC AND SPECIAL. THE NUMBER OF READERS AND
FREQUENCY OF LOANS MUST BE MONITORED. THUS LIBRARIANS MUST BECOME FAMILIAR NOT
ONLY WITH THEIR READERS' INTERESTS BUT ALSO WITH THE DETAILS OF THE LITERATURE
PRESENTED TO THEM. LIBRARIANS MUST NOT BE LEFT ALONE BUT ASSISTED AND GUIDED
EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE BY EXPERT ADVISERS, WORKING IN PARTICULAR AT THE
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES OF REGIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. THEIR WORK MUST BE
ADAPTED TO THE NEW, MUCH MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1980S AND BE
MORE EFFICIENT, TOO. BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALISM HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED,
ACTIVITIES MUCH BETTER COORDINATED. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY
IN SOFIA MUST RETAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS FIELD.
