POSSIBILITIES OF LITERATURE SUPPLY FOR THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS.
     
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ON LITERATURE USAGE, UNIVERSITY-ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WILL
GRADUALLY VANISH. SINCE THESIS PRESENTATION AT A FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY IS
ONLY NECESSARY FOR A PHD, TASKS MUST BE ASSIGNED WHICH REQUIRE A CERTAIN
EXPERTISE IN SPECIAL LITERATURE. 1 OR 2 SESSIONS ARE INADEQUATE TO TEACH THESE
SKILLS, AND LECTURES CAN ONLY BE INFLUENTIAL IF A GOOD LIBRARY IS AVAILABLE TO
STUDENTS. THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY AT SZEGED HAS AN EXCELLENT LIBRARY,
WHEREAS THE BUDAPEST FACULTY HAS NO REAL, UP-TO-DATE LIBRARY. A SOLUTION IS
EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
