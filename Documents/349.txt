RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HERTFORDSHIRE LIBRARY SERVICE.

(ABRIDGED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN THE HERTS LIBRARY SERVICE'S 'LIBRARY
AUTOMATION PROJECT NEWSLETTER NO. 7'.) HERTFORDSHIRE LIBRARY SERVICE HAS
AWARDED A CONTRACT TO AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS (ALS) FOR AN ON-LINE
CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM. ALS WILL BE USING EXISTING BAR CODES TO PERMIT THE
ISSUE, RETURN, RENEWAL AND RESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, WITH ON-LINE
BORROWER REGISTRATION AND ENQUIRY AND ON-LINE BOOK ACCESSIONING AND ENQUIRY TO
A SHORT ENTRY CATALOGUE. ACCESS WILL BE BY ACRONYMIC KEYS TO AUTHOR AND TITLE,
BY CONTROL NUMBER AND CLASS NUMBER. IF ALL GOES WELL, HITCHIN AND HEMEL
HEMPSTEAD WILL 'GO LIVE' TO THE PUBLIC AT THE END OF 1981.
