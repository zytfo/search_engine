WHAT DO STUDENTS READ IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES?.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE JOINT MEETING OF THE STUDY GROUPS ON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
AND LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES IN ESSEN, JUNE 81. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TURN 1ST
TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FOR THE BOOKS THEY NEED BUT THEY ALSO FORM A LARGE
READER GROUP IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF A UNIVERSITY TOWN. RECENT SURVEYS MADE
IN COLOGNE AND BOCHUM REVEAL THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS A DOUBLE FUNCTION FOR
STUDENTS, COVERING BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED LITERATURE DEMANDS. THE
STUDENTS SHOW GREAT INTEREST IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS AND THEIR
INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUALS THAT OF THE REST OF THE GENERAL
PUBLIC. THEY BORROW LESS FICTION THAN OTHER READERS, ALTHOUGH THEY DO USUALLY
DEMAND WORKS OF HIGH LITERARY QUALITY AND THEY ARE ATTRACTED BY BRANCH LIBRARY
STOCKS AS WELL AS BY THOSE IN CENTRAL LIBRARIES.
